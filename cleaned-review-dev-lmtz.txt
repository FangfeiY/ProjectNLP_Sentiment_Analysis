what it is there to say about this album it is without doubt one of the greatest album of the popular music era however until recently i did n't know the album that well and so i 've put it on my ipod so that i 'd hear it a little more frequently with the ipod in shuffle mode occasionally a brilliant track would come on that i did n't know did n't even know it wa the beach boy believe it or not and i 'd rush over to the ipod to find out what the track wa only to find it wa from pet sound so what make it so good well for me it the combination of the beautiful sound that brian wilson produced for the album combined with his brilliant songwriting perhaps it best summed up by 'god only knows' which is such an exquistely crafted song with trademark beach boy harmony and that achingly beautiful melody however the marvellous 'here today' push it close a the best track on the album it really should n't matter what sort of music you like this album should be in your collection 

there is nothing that i can say about this album that ha n't already been said but i would like to express my profound moment of discovery when i first listened to it i had the preconception that the beach boy were just a bunch of dumb surfer my musical taste leaned towards jazz classical and more progressive rock but i kept on seeing this album on list of the greatest album of all time so i gave it a try i wa n't prepared for the beauty of this perfect musical mixture of sound and mood it wa clearly a very personal record that expressed many feeling i had at the time the production is brilliant being a big fan of the beatles i immediately heard simmilarities between george martinand sgnt pepper and how they must have been influenced by this record this is not surfer music it is much more 

pet sound appears on many top 50 100 500 list for very good reason it wa a masterpiece when released ok i did n't exist when it wa released so i'm basing this on the knowledge of album coming out around the same time period it is still a masterpiece today however not many people know just how much of their music today wa either influenced directly by pet sound or influenced by a band that wa influenced by pet sound in the rolling stone top 500 album list only one album rank higher sgt pepper 's lonely heart club band in interview with paul mccartney he ha stated that this album influenced himself and through proxy if nothing else the beatles themselves sgt pepper wa seen a the beatles response to pet sound and some argue it top pet sound others it equal and to others still doe n't live up to pet sound if you are a fan of the beatles or any other band that share their influence you owe it to yourself to hear this album at least once in your life to understand just what this album ha done for the world of music multi layering vocal instrument and sound effect bicycle bell really and you 'll be surprised that is actually work all come together in an amazing sonic experience that just ha to be heard to be believed i understand that the beach boy may not be for everyone you may not be able to appreciate the music but listen and appreciate how influential the album wa and no just because it wa influential it doe n't mean you have to enjoy it i'm just saying that if you want to understand music you need to listen to this album so how doe this particular set get to be called complete it contains every version of the album recorded it contains a cd that ha the original mono recording the recording the group focused on when it wa originally created along with a fairly newly minted stereo mix for those that claim that stereo of this album is sacrilege you must realize that brian directly oversaw this project and what it brings to the table is what brian himself approved the only disappointment with the stereo mix for me is the missing sound and some vocal accompaniment this is all explained in the booklet with the set however essentially these vocal and sound do n't exist outside of the final mono mix and a there is no easy way to lift the vocal sound from the final mono mix they had to make due with what they had the missing piece are minimal and will of course always lend credence to the 'superiority' of the mono mix however i feel each mix ha it place and gladly listen to either then you have the 5 1 mix this mix is also missing the same sound vocal accompaniment of the mono mix for the same reason the producer ha also created another brian approved mix so there are essentially 3 valid mix for this album all brian approved this mix carefully blend the front sound stage with the rear to give the album a surround feel you almost feel like you are in the middle of the band i personally prefer the mono and stereo mix but 5 1 mix should n't be dismissed a it doe have it merit who would n't want to be sonically surrounded by this amazing album it 's not a mix i find myself wanting to listen to all the time but it is a great companion to a great album included on the dvd portion of the album is the 5 1 mix which is nice however the real shining star is the high quality 96khz 24 bit pcm stereo mix this brings even more depth and breadth to this album there is also a bonus track a 96khz 24 bit pcm mono mix of hang on to your ego for the video portion they take a look at the making of pet sound with interview with many involved in it creation you also get personal reflection on the album by many involved in it creation along with a bbc show excerpt promo clip and a god only know photo slide show to accompanied by that track if you are a fan of pet sound do yourself a favor and purchase the 40th anniversary cd dvd set you get a completely complete collection of each version of the album mono stereo and 5 1 and some great video exploration of the album if you are n't a fan of the album i still recommend you hear the album at least once for which i recommend the mono album or the mono stereo album if you can find it this album wo n't change your mind if you are n't a beach boy fan but it will give you some insight on a highly influential album highly recommended of note there is a mobile fidelity sound lab high quality sacd version of this album coming down the line my only issue with this album is that it only contains the stereo mix no mono version will be included considering the trouble they had in trying to rebuild the album in stereo to the point of excluding certain sound and vocal accompaniment i ca n't see why mfsl would choose to offer just the stereo mix on sacd considering this dvd contains the same sonic quality 96khz 24 bit pcm i'm not sure how much of an improvement the sacd will offer if the mfsl included a 96khz 24 bit pcm mono version of the album a well i 'd recommend it in an instant guess i 'll hold off my judgment of the mfsl sacd until it is released 

in 1966 when it wa released this album did n't sell a well a previous beach boy album i do n't know why i thought it wa fantastic now it 's regarded a a critical success well i guess better late than never the subject matter is mostly boy girl relationship sloop john b is a notable exception with a little venturing into the territory of introspection but the music the melody and instrumentation rival the music of the beatles' rubber soul in variety and inventiveness and like those song these manage to display that genius in the standard then 3 minute track god only know is one of the most beautiful ballad i have ever heard and i'm not saying that because of the religious reference because i am an agnostic would n't it be nice sound like a more typical beach boy record but the lyrical content wa daring enough to get it banned on some radio station caroline no is gorgeous the lyric and the music this cd give it all to you in both mono and stereo mono may be ok for sentimental reason but i recommend the stereo track 15 27 for sheer pleasure too bad that brian wilson suffered a mental decline after this album who know what he might have produced 

ok i have read several review here giving this masterpiece a two and three star rating and for the reason being that it is not the greatest album ever so if the album doe not qualify a greatest ever it get a wow that is going to leave a couple million record with out there well in my humble opinion this is arguably the greatest album ever and guess what this is the only beach boy album i own so do n't go calling me some beach boy fanatic but i can respect genius especially genius that is a far ahead of it 's time a this album every song is brilliant and in just the right place i would put it in the category of led zeppelin iv who 's next and several other classic you do n't think it is the best ever so be it but spare me these and star rating that is ridiculous 

i guess that by now saying that you love music and not be fond of pet sound is almost a paradox since brian wilson 's skywritten testament embodies everything that 's good about pop music excellent tune lyric vocal harmony and even some flourish to add a wonderful dreamy and lush feel to it all you still believe in me god only know and i know there 's an answer are certainly among my favorite song and added proof that good music tower through the decade without losing a trace of it greatness forever change odessey and oracle and pet sound will always be great come what may 

this really is one of the great album ever and the remastered sound is very good the only big difference between this mp3 version and the two disc set of the same recording is that the set give you a dvd with a making of documentary and both the original mono mix and new stereo mix plus a bonus track this mp3 set ha only the remastered stereo mix pet sound wa a groundbreaking record and had a huge impact on other musician it is definitely the high water mark for the beach boy this is not anything like their early jan dean inspired surf music it invented a whole new vocabulary of sound and form for pop music more than ever before the beach boys' leader brian wilson decided he wa going to go in a new direction and write a cohesive album over the protest of many others in the band he wa definitely right the beach boy never reached this level of creativity again but pet sound wa enough to put them in the pantheon of the great even if this quality of artistic achievement wa not sustained over time wilson say he wa inspired to make the record by the beatles' rubber soul album the beatles in turn credited pet sound a the inspiration for sgt pepper 's lonely heart club band paul mccartney still say he is crazy about the album john lennon even acknowledged it and george martin said sgt pepper 's would never have been made without pet sound eric clapton say it 's one of the greatest pop album of all time and elton john talk about how it changed the way he and everyone else approached recording i say this just to underline that it 's hard to underestimate the impact this record had on the development of popular music a we know it there are plenty of greatest hit here the album start out with the classic would n't it be nice one of the most optimistic and upbeat romantic pop hit ever and which also includes incredible layer of sound that deserve a good listening to with headphone god only know wa the b side to that single but became a major hit on it own caroline no sloop john b let 's go away for a while and here today were also single and are probably known at some level by most listener but do n't just get it for the hit a lot of the other song are slower and more complex but are really marvel of both pop composition and sound engineering especially when you think about the 1960s technology they were working with there are layer upon layer of crystal clear sound to enjoy and get lost in this album is every bit a impressive a recording a something like pink floyd 's dark side of the moon it just seems lighter because well it is it 's an optimistic feel good record even when it get sad and melancholy which it doe pretty often i still ca n't figure out quite how brian wilson pulled that off if you do n't know pet sound this deal ca n't be beat especially at the 1 99 deal of the day price on may 1 2009 once the price go up again also consider one of the cd or cd set available out there you wo n't regret it 

what can i say a pop masterpiece especially if you sequence 34 would n't it be nice 34 34 do n't talk 34 34 let 's go away for a while 34 34 god only know 34 34 i just wa n't made for these time 34 34 pet sound 34 and 34 caroline no 34 i would compare 34 caroline no 34 in particular to bacharach 's and david 's and warwick 's 34 anyone who had a heart 34 a good a the genre get 

the merit of this album need not be discussed here pet sound ha been widely regarded a a pop classic for over forty year and it popularity show no sign of letting up what doe need addressing however is the sound capitol ha achieved in rendering this recording in mono on cd the remastering game that ha been going on for the past decade ha yielded mixed result record company promising superior sound have come up short more than half the time when it come to reissuing classic lucky for u that 's hardly the case with this reissue of the beach boys' finest hour pet sound in mono is what every fan hope for when plunking down hard earned cash for an album he already owns the sound is incredibly warm with every instrument coming through distinctly the harmony coalesce in a way you simply do n't hear on a stereo mix and the immediacy is impressive 

by far the best beach boy album and the best brian wilson album along with the recently unearthed treasure smile the harmony and lyric in the song are perfect and remain timeless no matter how many time you listen to it or how many year have passed since this masterpeice first hit the shelf it wa n't a big hit in the state mostly due to the fact nobody wa ready for it it 's such a well organized and cohesive work much unlike what people were used to the beach boy putting out at the time they decided to be something more than just a surf band or a catchy and trendy pop band something which nobody gave them credit for compare god only know to 409 or surfin' safari and you shall understand what i mean the melody are perfect and blend greatly with the vocal this is a rare album without a single track to be skipped if you have n't caught on yet freaking buy this 

this is a masterpiece i wo n't get into the sgt pepper or rubber soul v pet sound i let this classic stand on it own brian wilson stretched his wing on this one and the band followed it is at time a little uneven but the music stand up quot would n't it be nice quot and quot god only know quot are the deserved hit but do n't push aside the other not so popular title like quot i just wa n't made for these time quot quot i know there 's an answer quot and probably the most underrated beach boy song of all time quot caroline no quot a truly introspective album it 's deserving of the classic label truly a fantastic album the beach boy showed they could do more than just surf and drag 

do i recommend it of course i just want to say that being used to the mono mix for so long i wanted to hear it in stereo but honestly the stereo mix doe n't do anything for me naturally this is an important piece of any music collection 

this is possibly one of my favourite album period the melody beautiful the harmony arrangement etc were well beyond their time for a record released in 1966 it sound amazing on cd a far superior album to either sgt pepper 's and a bit better than rubber soul there are only a couple of song i do n't really like a tiny gripe i have with the album the melody on song such a do you still believe me are a bit repetitive although nonetheless very good btw the song 'god only knows' is often cited a the album 's best but personally i would rank it about 3rd or 4th on the album 

doe everyone already know that the title track pet sound wa an instrumental piece written specifically for a james bond movie and then rejected by the film 's producer for anyone who think they know or love this album the pet sound box set is a must people will never fully realize the perfected magnificence of brian wilson and the beach boy until they analyze these pet sound composition and arrangement broken down 'instrumental only' and 'vocals only' through a pair of really high quality headphone 

please note this review is for the new audio fidelity gold version of pet sound for some reason amazon is grouping review of this album under one heading one of brian wilson 's masterpiece pet sound wa his response to the increasingly sopisticated album by the beatles working with the best session musician in the business something wilson would do while the rest of the beach boy were touring wilson composed and produced pet sound and then invited the band to come in and do the vocal contribute lyric a needed etc this new audio fidelity remaster is the second time that steve hoffman ha done this popular title evidently the original mastertapes are in fragile shape so hoffman used a first generation copy that wa unequalized the same one he used on the dcc release to remaster this again i never had the dcc but i did have the capital mono master and this edition blow away that version which used noise reduction the album sound warm and inviting with nice detail and is n't compressed or too loud the disc is also hdcd encoded for those with high definition cd player after the debacle with the reissue of heartbeat city it appears that audio fidelity got this one right the booklet includes brian wilson 's note on his intent with pet sound a well a photo but it doe n't include the extensive booklet that came with the previous capital edition of the album which is a bit disappointing i should note though that all the musician that played on this classic release are credited in the booklet other than that this is a terrific reissue and is available for a limited time with each edition numbered on the cardboard sleeve that house the jewel box brian wilson 's classic song cycle ha never sounded better to me highly recommended 

i like the beach boy but i have to admit that i prefer their earlier california style hit e g fun fun fun and i'm not a big fan of 60 music nevertheless pet sound is undeniably a beautiful cd that still sound great today sloop john b and would n't it be nice were top 10 hit in the u and god only know and caroline no cracked the top 40 but all the songds sound great brian wilson 's voice ha never sounded more beautiful and the harmony are near perfect a a bonus hang on to your ego is included it wa recorded at the same time but not released it 's a great song and may be familiar to alt rock fan via a remake by frank black the liner note are also terrific and include comment from brian wilson a well a a song by song description great cd 

just lay back and listen brian wilson never miss a note his voice wa one of the natural wonder of sixty pop his composing and arranging skill are without peer and he even play some awesome bass the slow middle eight section on quot would n't it be nice quot on this album these song are the sound of former teen idol settling into adulthood and feeling both excited and uncertain recorded with a large selection of musician and sung heartbreakingly well by the beach boy themselves this is a true pop magnum opus the best track are the gorgeous quot you still believe in me quot quot do n't talk put your head on my shoulder quot the title cut and the tear inducing quot caroline no quot instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity brian wilson invite you into his world and lay his soul bare with a suite of song that have n't aged a day since 1966 the more you listen to quot pet sound quot the more it 's beauty envelope you 

the last person who reviewed pet sound entitled his review masterpiece and gave it 1 star he 's entitled to his opinion though i'm not one to agree with it even mike love had his skepticism when he 1st heard the instrumental track to pet sound brian wilson had retired from touring in 1965 due to emotional problem and pressure to write and compose more for the beach boy though many missed his presence onstage this allowed him to really get out the sound inside his brain he wa especially impressed with the craftmanship of the beatles' rubber soul which came out around christmas of that year long story short while brian 's brother carl and dennis mike love al jardine and bruce johnston were busy touring the world from 1965 66 brian composed and performed on the instrumental track reducing the band to backup singer would n't it be nice open the album with promise and optimism and a jaunty koto solo sounding much like a young man bent on making his romantic dream come true dennis can be heard singing backup with cupped hand over his mouth you still believe in me came from an earlier song in my childhood and featured the sound of a bicycle bell and a car horn from the song childhood mike sings lead on that 's not me do n't talk is both haunting and romantic with it string and the bass which sound like a beating heart i'm waiting for the day ha lyric about a man hopeful to help a woman forget about the last jerk who broke her heart this piece is heavy on the drum particularly in the intro and at the false ending and woodwind oboe accompanying the verse and flute soloing at the last verse let 's go away for a little while sound like it could be during a romance scene in any 1960 's movie with vibe string a sax and a slide guitar sloop john b is a traditional folk song it wa al 's idea that they record this in 1965 carl sings lead on the ethereal god only know which brian got the idea from praying cynical mike retorted well i pray to god it sell orchestration includes string french horn accordian and harpsichord one take includes a sax solo i know there 's an answer wa originally hold onto your ego mike 's condition for singing on it wa that the lyric were more optimistic sounding mike sings lead on here today one of the more commercial piece i just wa n't made for these time is brian being brutally honest about the struggle inside himself if you 've ever thought to yourself nobody understands me you 're sure to relate this feature an eerie theramin solo amidst the heartbreaking melody the instrumental title track pet sound cheer thing up a bit finally there 's one of the saddest breakup song ever caroline no brian lament the warmth and sweetness in caroline have disappeared forever at the end you hear the sound of a train and brian 's dog barking pet sound may not have sold well when 1st released but ha earned crtical acclaim and the right to be known a a masterpiece 

i have heard many thing said about quot pet sound quot and none are shorter than the truth no album ha ever caught such raw emotion a this and none will but to acclaim it a the greatest of all time leaf me wondering were you 're coming from let 's start by analyzing the two thing that make up great music lyric and instrumentation lyrically quot pet sound quot is still a beach blonde hair doo type album with quot would n't it be nice quot and quot sloop john b quot restating the surfin year of brian wilson without these song this album would have easily been lyrically superior but every chain ha it weaker link and these song seem made for the chart after listening to this album 2 or 3 time straight i feel inferior the mood this album set is up there with the mood i felt when i listened to quot nebraska quot for the first time the music is what make this album so great the lyric are excellent in most song do n't get me wrong but there are some spot that could have been removed to compare quot pet sound quot to quot sgt pepper 's quot is just rediculous although many will argue that sgt pepper 's wa made a a rebutle to pet sound we still have to look at the fact sgt pepper creates a mood with lyric and instrumentation that had never been done it had been done in pet sound but never to an extent to lend itself to the music a much a sgt pepper 's it took me three or four listens to pet sound before i declared it musically innovative while it only took me the first track of sgt pepper 's to declare it musically superior to anything i 've heard up until then with the exception of revolver and blonde on blonde which is different musical innovation altogether we must first remember too that quot pet sound quot itself wa a rebutle to quot rubber soul quot which prof that the beatles were no follower they created their own music and others took a seat behind them to pick up some pointer but it 's not the lyric that lend itself to the greatness of this album it 's pure and simply the mood when i got done listening to this album i felt like cry i felt a though someone with so much emotional problem and societal anguish had sat down right beside me and poured his gut out musically this album is astonishing but a lot of the song seem revamped almost re used maybe that 's just the mood which can often time leave you thinking that you 've just listened to one song for 40 minute which is not a bad thing often time it 's the best compliment an album can get i think this album wa also the first to end on the most important note the one note that leaf the listener satisfied and dismayed at the same time this powerful ending may have been stolen for sgt pepper 's but then again you ca n't make a musical advancement if you do n't learn from the artist of today and what pet sound did wa definanlty a musical advancement this album is brian wilson nothing more nothing le everything here is his most inner feeling what more can you ask from an album than truthfulness in conclusion i would recomend pet sound to every serious music fan and even those that are just trying to break into popular music but do n't run around comparing it to sgt pepper 's because the two have different motif for one thing sgt pepper ha the emotion of 4 people while pet sound ha one but the emotion of pet sound still manages to top that of sgt which is an incredible foot i feel a though i 've contradicted myself so just grab your box of kleenex and pop this album into the cd or record player you will not be disapointed thank youdave 

i do n't care if this entire world that 's mostly full of people who either hate the beach boy or only think of them a a surf car band think or will think that pet sound is overrated dull corny whatever i'm not a bitter about emoting one 's self a they seem to be i do n't care about whether it stack up with sgt pepper i always thought that album wa a step down in song quality from the perfect revolver but that 's just me one influenced the other and that 's it i do n't even care how many time it top the list a best album of all time i do n't think that sort of thing is possible and it only lead to backlash like on here i just know that pet sound changed my life that at the end of the day when i play it i feel love and mercy and acceptance it 's my favorite album out of my hundred of cd if music 's my religion then pet sound is my bible thanks brian wilson and to paraphrase my favorite song of all time quot i wish that every listen wa neverending oh would n't it be nice quot 

back in 1962 stan getz tenor sax and charlie byrd acoustic guitar collaborated to produce 'jazz samba' an album which combine the sound of west coast cool jazz with the swaying rhythm of the bossa nova i do n't listen to much jazz so i'm hardly qualified to review the album from this perspective nonetheless 'jazz samba' ha a lot of appeal for me a someone with more mainstream taste in popular music whilst the playing of stan getz is far from aggressive it is the dominant feature of the album he ha a fluent and unforced style of playing one which give the impression that he is breathing into the saxophone rather than blowing into it by contrast the delicate playing of charlie byrd is far more subdued even if there are time when his playing seems to be relegated to that of accompaniment only at least that 's how it struck me he also present the listener with a number of exquisite short solo the supporting musician on acoustic bass 2nd guitar and drum provide the rhythmic impetus for the album and their playing is also a delight i like the whole album but because i tend to prefer music with a somewhat slower tempo 'desafinado' 'samba triste' 'samba de uma nota so' and 'bahia' are the song that i enjoy most there is a bonus track compared to the original vinyl release but a far a i can tell this is nothing more than a 2 minute radio edit of 'desafinado' my version of the album wa advertised a 're issued and re mastered' but the word 're mastered' appears nowhere in the liner note production credit my copy is a 'verve master edition' with liner note boasting 'high resolution 20 bit digital transfer' this sound pretty impressive and i must say that subjectively i thought the sound quality wa exceptionally good 'jazz samba' feature a lot of fine playing from all of the musician and i think the sound quality is outstanding the music creates a spacious atmosphere and it also ha a high 'chill factor' i think 'jazz samba' is an essential purchase for anyone who like the sensuous and infectious rhythm of modern latin american music 

not a good a the getz gilberto album how many album are recorded two year later but it is a very enjoyable effort by saxman getz and guitarist charlie byrd unlike the getz gilberto record this one ha no vocal it 's a short and sweet instrumental effort without a note wasted or misplaced desafinado out of tune and samba de uma nota so one note samba are the standouts the album is expensive considering the 35 minute playing time but you will listen to it many time trust me 

the perfect introduction to u s filtered bossa nova i say 'u s ' because the sound charlie byrd and stan getz bring to these classic are considerably smoother and broader than original which can be often raspy or intensely private but always richly nuanced getz 's playing is masterfully self effacing never virtuosic for it own sake you might forget he 's even there a he conduct intimate conversation with byrd 's often reinhardt like guitar or the quietly insistent rhythm and yet he is the soul of this beach music that sound so sad the best track are the old jobim favourite 'desafinado' and 'one note samba' in which the familiar melody are taken through the most intricate yet never alienating variation always obeying that hypnotic bossa nova beat 'e luxo se' is a wide eyed beauty beaming the kind of melody that make you instantly happy no matter how miserable you felt before you heard it the same could be said for the whole of this marvellous album perhaps best listened to at night when you 're feeling weary ready to dream 

this is probably the best if not the most important and significant jazz album that i have and will probably ever own hand down it wa the first cd i ever owned and still in my top 10 list of all time getz is one of the key contributor to introducing the american public to the nuance soul and sensuality of brazilian influenced jazz back in the early 60 quot desifinado quot is a punchy playful tune that take the listener upon a delight samba dance quot samba triste quot is sad and soulful so much so that you can hear the tenor sax lightly cry in getz 's hand in all track getz and byrd take the listener to a point of jazz induced high low and in betweens only to gently pull you back and forth a few more time before slowly ending each dance so you feel complete if you have never tasted the richness of south american influenced jazz this is probably the best place to start dinner is served and with getz byrd a your chef be prepared to experience a sensuous and filling 5 course meal bottom up moving in stereo d i robert 

i first heard this album in the mid 1980s when i wa running a used record store in florida i did n't know samba from sambo and had only a vague idea of who stan getz and charlie byrd were at the time but after playing the lp a few time i wa hooked this music wa unlike anything else i wa listening to at the time classic rock alternative rock vintage soul etc but it really struck a chord irresistable and magical tune the kind that truly evoked a unique mood and atmosphere i played the record to death and have done likewise with my old cd copy this music just never get old or boring a classic in the truest sense of the word you do n't have to be a jazz fan to enjoy this just let the music play and let it soak into your consciousness laid back and lovely 

i think it is important to remember that this site is an international one with reviewer and browser from all over the globe so i can easily see brazilian shaking their collective cabesas over the comment that this wa the first bossa nova record it wa definately one of the first to introduce samba and bossa rhythm to the u s both dizzy gillespie and cannonball adderley were using bossa standard in their repetoire at the time also much to the chagrin of some of their fan a to the comment that quot jazz samba quot is a better and more fluid recording than quot getz gilberto quot i can not agree byrd is a great player and even a great player in the brazilian mode but he is no joao gilberto quot jazz samba quot is 'fluid' in my opinion also but because the dynamic are never bumped up a notch quot getz gilberto quot ha more subtlety better playing by all the musician involved jobim 's piano work on 'corcorvado' alone is more subtle and his chordal sparcity on quot doralice quot more dynamic than any moment on quot jazz samba quot and one incredible singer to boot and i do n't mean astrud getz play far better and way more 'in the pocket' with joao and a real brazilian rhythm section do n't get me wrong i love this recording quot o pato quot is a masterpiece for it time and the recording stand up well today in general but when the first quot bossa nova quot recording wa made ha been discussed at length some even say laurindo almeida may have made it a decade before but the general consensus is that jobim gilberto lyra castro neve et al were doing it in the later half of the 1950s that doe not diminish the greatness of this recording then and it sound great today a well 

stan getz and charlie byrd have managed to adapt and introduce a whole new music genre with this important and seminal album the title is very apt and describes not just the music on this album but also the whole subgenre that developed from this later on despite this this album remains the standard by which all other pretender will be judged i believe there are other version especially the japanese remastered one which provides a better sound quality than this version that i recommend to get if you can still find it what is remarkable about the album is charlie byrd 's great guitar work naturally stan getz play up a storm throughout and his solo on the first track is brilliant but i believe byrd 's playing ha been overlooked a a guitarist myself i'm astounded by what he doe on an acoustic guitar playing at high speed and great phrasing too amazing what he accomplished in relative obscurity compared to the modern day guitar god whose phrasing do n't come close to what this guy display on all the track here a great album and i highly recommend you try and get a more recently remastered version if you can 

this is the album that kicked off the bossa nova craze in the u over 40 year ago in the hand of lesser musician this style could degenerate into lightweight cocktail music but not here stan getz 's feathery soft saxophone playing weave beautiful melody over the swaying dancing brazilian rhythm charlie byrd 's is terrific on the acoustic guitar and the tune will get stuck in your head after 3 spin or le the only possible complaint is the short playing time a mere 35 minute this recording is n't a well known a getz gilberto but is just a essential if you like getz 's playing be sure to get some of his other non bossa nova recording a well one more caveat those looking for more vocal by astrud or joao gilberto will be disappointed this cd is entirely instrumental 

3 1 2relaxed classic known for being the first full fledged american bossa nova record is not exactly gripping but still tightly chill enough to constitute compositional significance with the getz byrd dynamic lending to some interesting synergy not quite the landmark of next year gilberto collaboration but completely important in it own right 

how do you critique the album that started an era forty year later jazz samba is still one of the most relaxing rhythmically pleasing album made all instrumental with the tenor sax of stan getz the guy john coltrane professed to admire and inspired guitar of charlie byrd the entire album wa recorded in one session in the performance hall of a washington d c church and it put legion of studio album to shame while desafinado and bahia are the best known track the album is a seamless experience and it is difficult to single out certain song a superior if getz is one of the master of the tenor saxophone it is also hard to separate his proficiency from the effort a a whole it truly come across a a tight ensemble effort for a contrast duke ellington 's masterful and equally essential money jungle released the same year find the trio of ellington mingus and max roach locked in a musical duel on a couple of track favorite i enjoy samba de uma nota so but every time i reach for jazz samba i alway listen to the entire album at least once this and getz gilberto belong in every jazz collection 

jazz is all about being evocative the greatest example of the genre have always been the one that take the listener to another place that have expressed emotion and idea with uncanny accuracy in essence the best jazz recording feel like they 're coming from somewhere inside you born out of your dream and private thought and inner longing which i guess is why i'm so fond of jazz samba the album 's warm lyrical tone instantly paint a portrait of some sun splashed and utterly peaeful brazilian beach a hidden little paradise by a crystal ocean but there 's more to it than that jazz samba 's lush texture and instantly hypnotic imagery are downright theraputic when you 're stressed out angry or depressed this is the ideal record to put on the hypnotic shuffling bass line that open desafinado cast a spell that is n't lifted until getz 's gorgeous velvety solo at the end of bahia the music radiates so much warmth and joy in the meantime wiping away just about every single one of your worry and fear it really is a neat trick of course like any great piece of music jazz samba is much more than music getz and byrd make for a formidable team bridging the gap between jazz 's emotive cool and bossa nova 's swinging sensuality with irresisitable finesse the music is simultaneously dreamy and upbeat hypnotic and energetic beautiful and propulsive basically it 's a great album and one that belongs in every jazz collection 

bossa nova music wa created largely by antonio carlos jobim and joo gilberto in the late 1950s and early 1960s when charlie byrd and his trio heard it they wanted to make a bossa nova album of their own the result is this wonderful cd the cd track set open with an extended version of desafinado the guitar get plenty of air time in bossa nova music and charlie byrd 's guitar solo stuns me with it beauty and sensitivity desafinado play with a few key change to enhance the quality of the number and the percussion work very well too samba dees day pick up the tempo considerably and this ought to brighten any party you play this at stan getz play tenor sax to perfection and buddy deppenschmidt along with bill reichenbach play the drum very very well samba triste is the only truly mournful sounding samba on this album the minor key work very well a stan 's melancholy solo enhances the forlorn flavor to samba triste samba de uma nota s oacute one note samba exudes elegance and style when you listen to this track the fusion of jazz and samba is very evident e luxo s oacute reverts to a faster tempo that really make you want to get up and dance wherever you are and bahia ba iacute a concludes the album with a silky elegance that is singularly beautiful there is one extra number the bonus track is the 45 rpm issue of desafinado naturally the shorter version of this number doe n't provide u with the luxurious meanderings of the full length track nevertheless it interest the listener to hear what the band chose to include and exclude when under time constraint they had to deliver the number fast yet with all the brightness of the full rendition you wo n't be disappointed the liner note include the original liner note by dom cerulli and there are great black and white photo of the band member playing john litweiler contributes an informative essay about the creation of the album a well the quality of the sound is excellent i highly recommend this cd for any fan of bossa nova music and people who enjoy jazz with a samba twist will cherish this one for age to come 

i wa fourteen when this album wa released and i wa instantly smitten over the year my musical taste have evolved but this album is a constant because it always sound fresh to my ear do a quick run through the sound sample and you will be transported to another place and time the music is relaxed but with a definite brazilian flavor incredibly there are no brazilian musician on this album the driving force is charlie byrd and his guitar and his love of the music itself in fact samba dees day is his composition the other track are from brazilian composer but none were involved in this album other than the fact that their work wa performed the reason why i call this album ground zero is it introduced bossa to u audience and quickly spread to the rest of the world remember this is wa before the web and it still spread and took hold more incredible is the genre wa relatively new i had assumed that it wa a traditional form of brazilian music but in fact it wa born in the 1950s so the fact that a group of american musician globalized it via this album is incredible a well there is a back story to this album that i will not go into here because i want to focus on the album itself i will say that until drummer buddy deppenschmidt and bill reinchenbach were pulled into the project it almost stalled in fact a check of verve 's session record show that byrd and getz and unnamed others attempted six samba generically named samba 1 through 6 in two session in october 1961 and none of the track were issued although the 1961 session did not bear fruit they must have learned some lesson because on february 13 1962 they returned to the studio a building adjacent to the all soul unitarian church in washington dc and laid down this album this session ha byrd and getz backed by charlie 's brother gene on guitar and bass and keter betts on bass with buddy deppenschmidt on drum and bill reinchenbach handling other percussion a the sound sample and history show they nailed it to my ear this fifty two year old album is timeless getz went to to collaboration with some of the creator and top brazilian musician in the genre culminating ingetz gilberto which may have eclipsed this one commercially however this remains ground zero for bossa nova 's world spread and is important musically and historically 

this is an amazing jazz album you got charlie byrd and stan getz together making the first bossa nova jazz record in the u s it got a grammy it made thousand of listener transport themselves to a calm south american beach to top it off the lead drummer buddy deppenschmidt is my own drum teacher how bos is that awesome jazz with a twist all instrumental my greatest discovery out of brazil since sepultura pop it in and chill 

this fabulous record show off the great artistry of a master musician on saxophone getz seems to have such a natural feel to this type of music the guitar of charlie byrd is also superb and blend into the music in a wonderful manner the other amazing aspect of this record is that i never tire of listening to it 

it seems sometimes this album at least by the public is overshadowed by the mega popular and best sellinggetz gilberto but that is somewhat harsh a this album is ever bit a worthy in fact the two should easily be bought together a both are essential bossa nova album and the only two album you need that belong to the genre a far a i'm concerned it 's a bit more accessible and more upbeat with more subtle swinging rhythm and quicker than it 's companion those who bought the aforementioned mega album and were let down a bit by the downtempo will be happy that this album contains what they wanted that 's not to say this album suffers from lack of gorgeousness right from the start an essential love song desafindo open up the album and the singing line are replaced by gorgeous saxaphone playing and while gilberto wa a vital part of that record charlie bird 's guitar playing blow gilberto away he actually play some solo and boy are they pretty mean very intricate and melodic and he 's just a good a providing a gorgeous rhythm a he is when he add spice and flair to the song the aforementioned beat are played great with the backing band and stan getz 's saxaphone is in fine form a usual and unlike it 's companion there are no vocal back to the song each of these song will satisfy the hunger for bossa nova rhythm but it 's not the same rhythm for the whole length of course and it 's a melancholy either the only track to be featured on later album desafindo is agruably better than the hit version a the instrumental section is a lot different a well a the intro it definitely wo n't replace the vocalist track but the vocalist track will never be like this one the whole album is not very long especially if you cut out the second cut of desafino why would you though but the time suit it just fine it 's over quick but it doe n't have any filler thank god bossa nova to the unitiated may be hard to find considering most well known bossa nova is the garbage you can find on one of those lame album you can find at any gift shop in palm desert california this trascends all of the elevator muzak garbage you can find at the aforementioned gift shop if you say you like bossa nova and all you own are one of those lame noveltly album the kind in those gift shop that are part of those listening thing with the cheap speaker that also sell native american music or a couple of album by thievery corporation i advise you pick this andgetz gilbertoand experience the real thing 8 0 10 

great companion to getz gilberto pure samba without singer charlie byrd went to brazil and heard the then unknown antonio carlos jobim he played jobim record for stan getz they got keter betts and two drummer went to all soul 's unitarian church in dc and created the first bossa nova samba record in the u a monster hit with desafinado it changed america and jazz forever for a decade every jazz player tried to imitate it the best selling jazz cd of the decade that 's how good it is a number one hit of the billboard jazz pop and rock chart at the same time no other jazz album not other album of any type not even kind of blue even getz gilberto ha ever achieved that listen to subtle polyrhythym drumming from deppenschmidt riechenbach which add an authentic carnivale touch there is more traditional samba polyrhythm on this cd than any of the subsequent getz bossa nova cd 's and most bn cd 's by subsequent artist who tried to capitalize om the bn craze hear this on e luxo so stan float and soar in desafinado portuguese for offkey e luxo so and bahia most authentic brazilian getz samba recording hear stan make each note 3 dimensional blue fog note count beautiful lyrical soaring one of the ten best jazz recording ever made from my 1998 review2006 updateyes it 's true a wonderful a sax man a getz wa and i think he wa the best he wa cheap he got all the credit and most of the money for this album and he and byrd fought over the right to it for a decade in the court nevertheless its' wonderful maybe that 's why they foughtthis cd is a perennial favorite that never grows old jobim had admired getz cool melancholy sound for a decade and had actually modeled his new toned down slowed down samba sound called bossa nova on the getz sound before they even met for people who like bossa nova but do n't like astrud gilberto 's singing on getz gilberto this is the ideal album see my list of best cool album and best getz highest recommendation i hope that when i eventually die no time soon at my funeral someone will play the soaring always happy e luxo so to send me on my way 

with bossa nova already achieving worldwide popularity by the 1960 's the latin jazzsubgenre from brazil then took another international step when stan getz and charliebyrd made there u s state department to south america in 1961 when they set outto discover the bossa nova after the return the bossa nova had reached the unitedstates a it resulted into the making of jazz samba the highly praised landmark duetalbum that topped the jazz and pop chart a introduce the subgenre to the americanpublic when it first came out in 1962 featuring a set of timeless composition pennedby antonio carlos jobim and ary barraso the first rate track set feature a solid recordof song that begin with the chart topping smash hit desfinado which procede withbarraso 's bahia jobim 's samba de uma nota so one note samba o pato the duck samba triste and e luxo so showcased with harmonic structure and it 's beautifully crafted tone jazz samba is a landmark masterpiece that will provide you with a superbsimultaneously warm full tone and a cool control of dynamic thanks to the chemistryof getz byrd jobim and barraso their truly melodic inventiveness romanticism andeven the undercurrent of melancholy inherent in the music make a revelatory classicthat will certainly remain a timeless a ever 

jazz samba the collaborative album of stan getz and charlie byrd is one of the most beautiful and relaxing album i own from the opening track destafino on throught to the final track baia listening to j is like being on the beach and watching the sun set the byrd getz combination is flawless the two artist compliment each other extremely well making this album a effortless listen again and again if you are new to samba music this is where to begin 

quot jazz samba quot is such a great album that only one other bossa nova album exceeds it quality quot getz gilberto quot getz and byrd jazz musician not only introduce brazilian bossa nova to a larger audience but do so in a way that is timeless many of the composition here have become classic of our culture quot desifinda quot quot samba de uma nota s oacute quot and quot o pato quot do n't worry if you do n't recognize the title once you hear them you recognize the music if you have quot getz gilberto quot than quot jazz samba quot wo n't disappoint this is great music that belongs in everyone 's collection 

it 's my first cd bought from amazon and it 's one of the best album of patti different style but a unique big voice hear her aretha 's voice in the track 5 for example track 1 is a new version of the first song in her album havana candy track 2 show u her ability to swing track 3 4 10 are beautiful ballad track 6 is the reggae one track 7 8 have a sweet sound track 9 is my favourite of the album in a gospel style 

this cd is not new but the world need to know how good this cd is iam a preacher in the wilderness if this cd is in your collection dust it of and give it a listen again this is by far one of patti austin finest work and need the attention it deserves 

this cd of the talented singer and favorite artist of grp production patti austin is charming great arrangement great sound and excellent performance and a range of experienced artist accompany these 10 song full of musical vitality very beautiful theme ' star in your eyes' which accompanies the legendary pianist bob james enjoy it 

a blessed union of amazing vocal and outstanding studio musician make patti austin 's that secret place a dazzling achievement whether it 's jazz or pop r b or gospel reggae or funk austin impeccably delivers a true command of whatever style she tackle in this 1994 release each track allows patti to effortlessly glide through each song with her penetrating performance she cook on tune like ability to swing a scat infused invitation to dance her cover of aretha 's classic rock steady and the euphoric drive of reach have fun with her reggae flavored captivated then let your heart melt with somebody make me laugh broken dream or the gorgeous star in your eye the album is flawlessly produced by jazz icon lee ritenour and dave grusin patti ha certainly deserved wider success in her career but for those who have wisely followed her know what a treasure she is 

in the world of motion picture the character performer tends to have a longer career than the so called leading man woman because the former can become whatever the script requires providing necessary support in the music world there are some artist that never become the star that they should but that doe not diminish their talent they simply become a delicacy to be savored by a select few patti austin is one of those delicacy she ha had a long career a solo performer and guest artist never quite gaining the status that she so richly deserves 1994 's that secret place is the perfect introduction for the uninitiated to the beautiful jewel that is patti austin backed on several cut by the like of lee ritenour guitar bob james piano paulinho da costa percussion greg philliganes piano synthesizer with string and horn arrangement by jerry hey austin travel a musical road consisting of jazz pop r b and shade of a little gospel influence ability to swing is a masterly executed mixture allowing the singer to show her shill a a vocalist and scat singer the band also get to cut loose in it accompaniment and solo interlude broken dream written by el debarge who also doe guest vocalist duty his brother darell and tony a redio is about the breakup of a relationship and the possibility of a reconciliation both debarge and austin play off each other quite well somewhat reminiscent of austin 's work with james ingram austin successfully cover the queen of soul 's territory on the funky remake of aretha 's classic rock steady captivated with it reggae influence allows austin to show a side not often found on her usual recording reach make the listener want to jump the pew while the tune that follows it star in your eye is a quiet yet powerful love ballad the best of all is hurry home an obvious plead for the hasty return of a long absent lover this tune share many quality with the oleta adams' hit get here patti austin ha done more in this one album than most of today 's chart topper can do in several she is what good music is all about and maybe one day she 'll get her much deserved prop 

i think this is by far the best cd i have ever purchased the singing is superb the music above excellent if you are new to bluegrass and alison krauss this is a good introduction to both 

i remember distinctly when i first heard one of the cut on the lp version of too late to cry on a radio show called grass root or something like that out of kalamazoo mi i stopped whatever i wa doing to listen closely to quot do n't follow me quot and then the first chance i got to get up to lansing 's elderly instrument the best darn music amp instrument store in michigan i bought it i think this recording is just about a perfect a anything since abbey road each song is a little gem i really prefer alison 's voice a it sound in these earlier recording stronger more nasal she purposely changed it to the softer more pop friendly version around the time of the quot every time you say goodbye quot i believe but her singing is not the only treat she had won many award for her fiddle playing by this time and it shine and she is backed up by only the best musician in bluegrass jerry douglas amp sam bush for example peppy strong and true to bluegrass root 

what a breath of fresh air in the country music field such an excellent cd shania and faith should listen to this see what a real singer is like at 15 no le and then quit the business 

in 1987 alison wa only 15 and some of the song on this cd are kind of quot honky tonky quot in quot song for life quot the lyric begin quot i do n't drink a much a i used to quot and it 's a little incongruous putting the word together with the 15 year old voice her vocal tone wa a little twangy and nasal sounding almost strident a she belted out some of these tune and i wonder if she wa influenced maybe a little by some of the nashville big hair bunch like reba still if she had not appeared until today and suddenly this recording appeared it would be at least a head turning today a it wa 15 year ago no other vocalist in the genre approach this kind of material with this kind of instrumentation with that kind of voice alison surrounded herself by superstar like sam bush and jerry douglas so the supporting cast wa top notch in her first recording she wa both astonishingly new and talented but also showed great promise of thing to come in the recording that followed she ha unfailingly measured up to that promise even in her first record she began showing her taste for sorrowful mournful tune of doomed love even on uptempto tune like quot do n't follow me quot and the title quot too late to cry quot she also began demonstrating her talent for beautiful slow ballad like quot gentle river quot required stuff for those who want the complete alison krauss collection but i knock it down to 4 star because the maturity of her voice and mastery of material would show up in full on later recording 

allison krauss ha an amazing voice her band is good too easy listening and easy to hum or sing along 

alison wa just fifteen when she made her recording debut with this album but even at that age she wa ready for it she is both only a talented musician and a wonderful singer with a great voice which ha echo of dolly reba and emmylou while not being too much like any of them her music ha changed significantly through the year so fan of her more recent album may not like her early work my eclectic taste in music allows me to enjoy all her music though i generally prefer the early stuff the song are mostly obscure the most widely known being song for life which is a classic from the pen of rodney crowell alison play the fiddle on all track where one is used but there are two instrumentals both cover tony trischka 's forgotten picture and the traditional dusty miller that demonstrate alison 's skill a a fiddler very clearly the remaining song are only original mostly from the pen of john pennell this may not be the best album that alison ever recorded though some think it is and i can understand why but it is certainly among the best it 's not difficult to figure out why alison ha been so successful if you are unfamiliar with alison 's early music you should first try now that i 've found you a collection if you enjoy that particularly the track sleep on taken from this album give this a listen 

this is true alison this is true bluegrass this is a wonderful cd 

i wa lucky enough to see this young lady and young she wa on tour twice when this album had just come out at the kalamazoo state theater along with hot rize another good old fashioned bluegrass treat these were the day when krauss wa more famous a a fiddle wunderkind than a pop sensation and when her voice sounded like a young brenda lee or jimmy martin 's kid sister rather than the limp but no doubt moneymaking dishrag it doe today krauss 's best contribution these day is her production work with new group like nickel creek these song none of which were written by krauss herself by the way are fine example of what in the eighty wa termed newgrass a bluer than bluegrass saucy treatment of american string band tradition the best example might be union station 's version of wait for it the allman brothers' midnight rider which a an allmans fan i like better than the original many of the other song are written by john pennell founder of the band still a member and one who can be credited with discovering krauss' talent a early a five year before this disc wa recorded the personnel of union station ha morphed throughout the year and a few of the song are led vocally by musician who are no longer in the band but most are krauss' baby and she show them off like a proud country mama if you have never had a chance to hear alison krauss during her early year on the road do check this her solo album or both out your heart will leap to the whirlwind melody and you will thank yourself believe me 

this is the real thing folk real singer and real musician making real music blow off shania and faith and buy this and every other alison krauss union station cd available 

still only 17 in 1989 when this her second album wa released alison krauss made a mark that ha kept her atop the heap in bluegrass ever since more of a quot band quot album than her debut this one also feature guitar phenom jeff white on lead vocal on a few tune and the instrumentals are among the best alison ha ever recorded mainly due to mr white 's hot flat picking old beaumont rag got a good workout here the album feature both traditional material like quot wild bill jones quot sung by jeff white now performed exquisitely by dan tyminski in alison 's band and innovative arrangement of material from other genre 's the allman brother 's quot midnight flyer quot get turned from rhythmic yearning ballad into a banjo driven barn burner with vocal that soar and harmony that are absolutely hair raising alyson 's voice is noticeably smoother than in the debut album and i would guess it wa about here that critic began saying that she had the voice of an angel i do n't personally know what an angel sound like but it would be a high compliment to say one sounded like alison krauss on quot two highway quot 

alison krauss ha one of the most beautiful voice her band is really good too easy listening easy to hum or sing along 

this wa alison 's second album but the first on which her band get title billing the musician were alison krauss fiddle mike harman banjo jeff white guitar john pennell bass jerry douglas dobro and brent truitt mandolin jerry and brent were not member of union station but were brought in a guest on the recording alison wa just 17 when these track were recorded but she wa already the supreme performer jeff white sings lead on wild bill jones a lovely a you lord do n't forsake me and midnight rider with alison and mike providing harmony vocal beaumont rag and windy city rag are instrumentals on all other track alison sings lead vocal with jeff and mike providing harmony vocal the last two track will be the most familiar teardrop will kiss the morning dew wa originally recorded by the osborne brother an excellent bluegrass outfit and wa also covered by billie jo spear both those version are somewhat obscure but alison 's own version wa selected for inclusion on now that i 've found you a collection the hugely successful compilation of alison 's music if you are thinking of buying this album you surely own that compilation already and if not you should buy that first the final track is a cover of gregg allman 's classic midnight rider here adapted to bluegrass brilliantly you are not likely to know many if any of the first ten track but they are definitely worth a listen they are a varied mix of ballad and up tempo but the overall feel of the album is upbeat possibly the best is heaven 's bright shore though it is difficult to pick out highlight on an album of such quality if you already have now that i 've found you a collection and you want to explore alison 's early music further this is for you 

great i repeat great cd well worth the money it 's one of her best 

listening to this album it 's very difficult to realise that she is only 18 she play the fiddle with a skill way beyond her year and her delicate soprano voice sings of lost love and heartbreak with such emotion and beauty that touch the heart of anyone who ha experienced love gone wrong this album wa just a hint of what wa to come and i had the pleasure of seeing her in concert a few year back in toronto this is bluegrass at it best buy it you 'll love it 

if you just stumbled across this album and gave it a listen you might be forgiven for thinking that it 's a greatest hit cd at this point ak already had a couple of album under her belt and it show the music is straight bluegrass and country you wo n't find any of the later pop infusion which is fine music itself and the song selection is first rate the instrumentalist are in fine form and her voice still ha most of that thin reedy quality that you associate with bluegrass but if you listen it 's just beginning to warm up some and lose that young girl quality so if you 're already an aku fan you can scoop this one up and enjoy every lick and if not this is a good a place a any to test the water 

my father in law listened to this cd while he wa dying steel rail will always be my favorite a with the other ak u cd this is the real thing folk real singer and real musician making real music blow off shania and faith and buy this and every other alison krauss union station cd available 

on her 3rd cd alison krauss doe not break stride quot i 've got that old feeling quot is chock a block full of the beautiful ballad that have made her famous with her angelically emotive voice but it is also perhaps the best showcase for her ability to perform more up tempo piece such a quot dark sky quot and quot will you be leaving quot the supporting cast here performs perfectly how many album do you have that have perhaps a few good song on it but just a many song that are just filler instantly forgettable and barely listenable this is a cd with no filler every cut is a quot keeper quot and i could just listen to the whole thing back to back over and over again alison krauss is a national treasure and this recording is one reason why 

allison krauss ha a really amazing voice and sound good band easy listening easy humming and easy to sing along 

alison krauss ha done much to popularise bluegrass in recent year her early recording were pure bluegrass this from 1990 might just be the best album of that phase of her career although they are all brilliant and it 's hard to choose a particular favorite her more recent album have included other influence but i enjoy those too in a different way there are no really famous song on this album but the quality of all the song is high sidney cox of the cox family a noted bluegrass group with which alison recorded a gospel album wrote four song including the title track a bright upbeat song and tonight i 'll be lonely too an outstanding ballad other favorite of mine include steel rail a brilliant train song endless highway will you be leaving and one good reason but there are so many great song here and it may be that your favorite is one i have n't mentioned the overall feel of the album is bright and upbeat if you are unfamiliar with alison 's early music i recommend that you buy now that i 've found you a collection which i 've already reviewed that includes one track from each of her early album plus track not available on any of her other album so far if you have that collection and you are looking for more of alison 's early music you will enjoy this 

i wanted to get an album with those union station guy not singing and with fewer ballad so i had to go back 15 year but found her voice and poignant expressiveness just a satisfying and moving a in her more mature year 

i listen to a wide variety of music and i think that alison krauss ha the most beautiful voice in all of today 's music the pop act of today ca n't compare quot i 've got that old feeling quot ha 12 exceptional song from bluegrass to country including the title song quot it 's over quot and quot wish i still had you quot not only can krauss sing she play the violin to perfection if you have n't listened to alison krauss yet you are in for a treat 

i 've had this cd a long time and it 's still very enjoyable especially when you 're in the right mood my favorite song are mostly the kind of wistful ballad where alison 's voice work great my favorite song here are i 've got that old feeling i wish i still had you winter of a broken heart it 's over steel rail that make one of u well that 's half the album right there and the other song are good too the production is n't a clear a more recent stuff but the musician are top notch in the end some album stick with you more than others and this one stand out a a keeper 

i must admit this cd wa in my shopping cart for quite a while given it genre i finally make the plunge when i needed it for free shipping and the first time i played it i could n't believe the beautiful purity and fullness of her voice the music is very interesting also since it is obviuosly country but these are real talented musician and the arrangement are incredibly performed and make a country band really kick in a cross over jazzy sense in a couple of tune where you 'd never guess this is a band that play bluegrass it 's worth every one of those star and one more if they had it by the way i found out that the lady like this cd very much 

i ca n't describe how wonderful this recording is but i 'll try whether you like bluegrass or not if you appreciate good singing good playing and wonderful melody this cd is for you many people have talked about how relaxing soothing and peaceful not to mention fun this collection is it 's that and more these are song that you will find yourself singing humming and thinking about after just a few listens alison doe a wide range of cover including the title track from the foundation a song by bad company quot oh atlanta quot and a wonderful version of the beatles' quot i will quot now about alison krauss you can read here and in many other place about the enormous talent alison ha been blessed with that is obvious in the initial hearing of the cd i appreciate the talent but even more i appreciate the love that she ha for music i 've seen and heard many performer in several different genre of music but it is becoming a true rarity to encounter artist who really truly love what they do you can tell that alison krauss and union station ha a geniune joy in doing what she doe it come across in the music that joy of singing performing communicating with an audience is sadly lacking with most artist today too many artist some who once had this joy and lost it somewhere along the way are in music for all the wrong reason money fame you name it krauss will have none of it she still record for rounder record a relatively small label even though she 's had offer from the big label she refuse to perform in big arena concert because she would lose the close connection she ha with her audience i admire her for her decision and for her love of her craft take one listen to this cd and i think you 'll agree 

what a beautiful album when allison krauss sings with union station her already wonderful sound are magnified and transform to simply angelic we especially enjoy tonight i 'll be lonely too sleep on and my favorite when you say nothing at all highly recommended for old time country sound baby now that i 've found you 

beyond alison krauss 's crystal clear vocal and some fine string player now that i've found you is blessed by a fine selection of tune and the kind of immaculate production found on modern blue grass recording anyone who listens to krauss and other quality bluegrass with an open ear will be pleasantly surprised by the big beat found in this drum le music 

since her rounder debut in 1987 alison krauss ha been praised by critic and country music fan alike revitalizing traditional style of country music including bluegrass the singer and fiddler is the focus of much public attention her unique yet firmly rooted approach to country music ha won her several grammys her 1995 release now that i've found you showcase her ability to shine in a variety of setting the title track and quot broadway quot find krauss in a more pop country environment however even her pop music is unique in it smart harmonic structure and her ability to avoid pat or stock poetic device on quot tonight i 'll be lonely too quot krauss and union station her almost constant musical companion switch to a decidedly bluegrass feel and on quot when god dip his pen of love in my heart quot she plunge into a southern gospel style with help from the cox family alison krauss ha the remarkable ability to make these diverse musical direction seem logical and congruent 

this wa the very first cd that we bought when we first got a cd player back in 1995 i loved it then and love it today it remains a firm favourite a well a some of her best song culled from previous album this album includes 3 previously unreleased song a great mix of country and bluegrass this is the best from alison krauss along with union station and the cox family from 1987 to 1994 the booklet includes some cute photo of alison and her brother a child but unfortunately no lyric but it doe have a 2 page newspaper article from 1994 which is interesting if you only get one alison krauss album then this is the one you need highly recommended 

alison krauss is definately a classy lady i think this compilation is a well rounded effort which show the multidimensional artist that is alison krauss whether she 's on a tribute album with union station solo producing there always seems to be magic in the studio now that i found you a collection give listener 3 new song 4 song from tribute album and the rest from her past album first new song is quot now that i found you quot featuring a usual stunning vocal and beautiful instrumentation we also have quot oh atlanta quot and quot broadway quot which are also new and great song probably one of her best known tribute song wa for the keith whitley tribute album her and union station 's cover of quot when you say nothing at all quot keith would be proud elsewhere on this cd we have quot i do n't believe you 've met my baby quot quot tonight i 'll be lonely too quot quot every time you say goodbye quot quot sleep on quot quot i will quot and many more overall this compilation should satisfy the biggest fan and the one who are just introducing themselves to alison 's music 

i bought the tape of now that i found you after seeing alison krauss and her union station bandmates in concert in branson missouri a number of year ago alison 's hit quot baby now that i found you quot a '60s pop song and quot when you say nothing at all quot the classic keith whitley song are on here i also liked alison 's remake of the old beatles song quot i will quot featuring some fine work by tony furtado on banjo not only doe alison do a beautiful job of singing and fiddling but her union station bandmates who accompany her on most of the song on this record are talented musician a well up until '95 when now that i found you wa released alison wa recognized mainly when she sang background vocal on other artists' record and her music though it is stellar did n't get noticed very much except by bluegrass and folk music fan this album which went platinum wa alison 's breakthrough because it got a lot more people interested in her music if you have n't heard alison krauss 's music before i recommend that you check out now that i found you it 's a great introduction 

this is the real thing folk real singer and real musician making real music buy this and every other alison krauss union station cd available 

if you like alison you 'll probably like this cd i found a couple of song i enjoyed the rest i ignore i recorded the one i liked on to another source if you are not a big fan of hers there are better sample of her work 

it took a few album for the rest of the world to discover what the bluegrass community already knew about the phenomenal alison krauss her voice is a once in a lifetime gift she had recorded about 4 album when independent label rounder and alison came up with the idea of a quot greatest hit quot collection for an artist in a genre that pretty much never ha a quot hit quot now that i 've found you open with three new track each one of them became a hit then is filled in with another nine track from the previous album plus a few gem she recorded a a guest vocalist on other 's cd such a quot i will quot from tony furtado 's quot within reach quot and quot i do n't believe you 've met my baby quot on jerry douglas' quot slide rule quot a wonderful old louvin brother 's song that received another wonderful treatment in the recent louvin brother 's tribute album check that one out too suddenly the young woman had a platinum album selling million and zillion of copy in a genre that no one outside of bluegrass listened to what wa going on bluegrass had a few hit in the rock and roll era flatt and scruggs quot foggy mountain breakdown quot the music used a the musical theme to quot bonnie and clyde quot flatt and scruggs quot the ballad of jed clampett quot the theme to quot beverly hillbilly quot quot dueling banjo quot from the soundtrack to quot deliverance quot quot rocky top quot by the osborne brother quot fox on the run quot by the country gentlemenbut it wa pretty much unheard of for a bluegrass recording or artist to get much notice outside of the bluegrass die hards unless there wa a movie or television tie in then along came alison krauss with her stunning crystalline voice that caught the attention of the bluegrass community while she wa still a teenager this cd really is just a quot sampler quot of alison krauss' voice but it 's a good starter disc for someone who want to hear the kind of voice that only come along once a generation 

allison krauss is truly talented and easy to hear very easy listening most allison krauss song are so easy on the ear 

alison krauss 's voice is beautiful haunting and full of passion and emotion alison and union station are set apart from other musician their virtuosity and ability to convey their emotion through their instrument is one of their trademark this release is no different and will not disappoint fan of alison and union station although this release wa intended to bring alison 's beautiful voice into the forefront up until this point alison wa known a a fantastic fiddle player but her voice wa overlooked due to the fact that she sang background vocal with the early version of union station this release introduced alison to the world and people began to take notice of her angelic voice there are some familiar tune like broadway baby now that i 've found you oh atlanta and every time you say goodbye alison doe all those song well but it 's the lesser known track that stand out i will an old beatles song and sleep on from alison 's debut too late to cry stand out a one of the gem on this disc in the palm of your hand is beautiful a is when you say nothing at all one of my favorite and i do n't believe you 've met my baby all the song are winner this disc ha something for everyone from the country infused sleep on to the more religious fare when god dip his pen of love in my heart and palm of your hand alison doe justice to all of these song and the cover are outstanding if you enjoy this collection you may also enjoy alison 's previous work this is a must have for any alison krauss fan 

what make this so special is the purity of alison 's voice and the quality of the music some of which feature alison a instrumentalist a well a vocalist even though most of the song are cover they sound fresh and exciting the track are taken from various source including one from each of her own album but also including three previously unreleased track plus other track that had not appeared on her album even if you 've got all alison 's other album you 'll need this the set begin with a cover of the sixty pop hit baby now that i 've found you you may remember the original a somewhat sad lyric but a very upbeat tune which wa a uk number one hit for the foundation alison slows the song right down in keeping with the lyric the final track is a cover of when you say nothing at all recorded for keith whitley 's tribute album this is a song that ha spawned a number of cover including irish version by boyzone who had a big british hit with it and france black even france cannot improve on alison 's version between those two track are many other brilliant song including i will from the beatles' white album teardrop will kiss the morning dew even better than the billie jo spear version which i think wa the original and the lovin brothers' i do n't believe you 've met my baby later covered by dolly on her little sparrow album the o brother soundtrack the various o sister compilation inspired by it and dolly parton 's recent album have all helped to increase the popularity of bluegrass but this compilation pre date all of them and it wa hugely successful in any case alison herself appears on most of those other album so this is an important album in any collection of bluegrass music 

this wa my first introduction to bluegrass music but i suspect this is a sophisticated style of the genre not the raw high wailing sound that i subsequently discovered in fact much of it could easily fit into category like quot adult contemporary quot or quot easy listening quot the track quot broadway quot for example is a pure pop song i love the dolly parton like quot teardrop will kiss the morning dew quot and the gospely quot in the palm of your hand quot but my top favourite is the wonderful dreamy story of quot i do n't believe you 've met my baby quot with it unexpected twist in the tale and it lilting hypnotic rhythm this is one of those rare album with no real dud track 

even back in 1995 alison krauss 's star wa shining brightly and this rounder anthology showcase her talent a vocalist fiddler interpreter and band leader the collection open with three then previously unreleased track including the gorgeous baby now that i 've found you her voice simply melt in you ear the other two new track include oh atlanta not to be confused with the little feat song of the same name and the ballad broadway written by sidney and suzanne cox six of the remaining song come from album done with union station the cox family and her 1987 solo album however what make this collection especially enjoyable is that it also includes when you say nothing at all aku 's contribution to keith whitley a tribute album along with i do n't believe you 've met my baby from jerry douglas 's abum slide rule and a moving rendition of the beatles' i will from tony furtado 's album within reach you wo n't find a better introduction to this amazingly gifted artist very highly recommended 

alison krauss along with her band union station is probably the best known bluegrass artist currently recording now that i found you a collection is a compilation of alison 's early work along with some new music even though she wa only 23 when she released this cd in 1995 alison had been recording since she wa 16 her pure voice shine through and the song are consistently excellent however three of them are real standouts baby now that i 've found you is my favorite selection and simply one of the catchiest song i 've ever heard whenever i hear it the tune get imbedded into my mind and play on a continuous loop for day the song wa originally a 11 pop hit in 1968 for the foundation who are perhaps better known for build me up buttercup it wa only a minor country hit for alison 49 in 1995 although it netted her a grammy for best country western vocal performance female when you say nothing at all is alison 's biggest country hit having peaked at 3 in 1995 what make it success all the more amazing is that it wa a 1 hit just seven year earlier for keith whitley it 's clearly become one of alison 's signature song the final standout for me is i will written by those great bluegrass artist lennon and mccartney only a tremendous talent like alison could make a beatles song into a bluegrass masterpiece this cd wa an unexpected hit selling more than 2 million copy it also helped alison win 3 major country music association award in 1995 horizon best new artist female vocalist and single of the year for when you say nothing at all i'm by no mean an expert on bluegrass and i admit that most of the bluegrass cd i own feature alison krauss however i certainly recognize quality music when i hear it and now that i found you a collection is outstanding contemporary bluegrass most highly recommended 

i'm not sure how this woman would be classified i guess it 's generally country music with a hint of bluegrass but in certain song i also detected some gospel influence note that i have never been a country music lover my taste in music is very wide west african brazilian greek electronica soul funk classic rock i saw alison performing on public tv a few week ago and wa just blown away so much so that i went out to buy the cd almost every track is wonderful in it own right alison 's voice is so beautiful but i think it 's the combination of all the talent on this cd that make it so wonderful the song writing is excellent and the banjo pickin' is also i'm so glad to have discovered her and to now have this cd in my collection 

this is the first cd i purchased by alison krauss and it is perfect there 's alot of fun on this album and alot of sad song a well but it is very worth the purchase if you enjoy good 90 's bluegrass this is the album for you alison 's voice will particularly grab you it did me 

this wa the first album i ever heard of thiers and when i heard it i imediately fell in love i really recommend this alot 

sometimes an abundance of talent can be a curse take alison kraus for example on one hand she ha bluegrass afficianados like me begging her not to give in to the lure of almost certain pop country superstardom while the rest of the world is screaming quot get rid of those hayseed quot i 've already tipped my hand so i will tell you that the bluegrass component of this album is about the best that can be heard in the genre 's more contemporary incarnation and while alison is clearly the star the boy in the band more than hold their own both vocally and instumentally dan tyminski is a terrific singer and guitarist his voice blend superbly with alison 's on quot blue trail of sorrow quot and particularly quot the road is a lover quot which also feature some great train like bowing from alison banjoist ron block take scrugg style picking to a higher level his driving solo on the title track blow me away every time i hear it and adam steffey 's mandolin playing rank among the best what more can be said about alison 's voice it 's clear emotive and haunting my only complaint about alison these day is that she is growing le and le inclined to cut loose on the fiddle i 've read her statement of getting away from quot flashy playing for it own sake quot but she 's far too talented on that instrument to let it collect too much dust for those whom skip over the non alison track or complain that the guy sing to much alison is following in the best tradition of the original bluegrass bossman himself mr bill monroe who handed over the reign repeatedly to such later star a lester flatt jimmy martin and peter rowan alison kraus and union station is a band and a damned fine one at that i just hope that she doe n't follow the path of the late keith whitley marty stuart dolly parton and ricky skaggs although we got him back forsaking bluegrass completely 

beautiful texture to this 2lp package nice acoustic sound without that yucky digital coldness well worth the now let 's get the other aku record done too 

one of alison and union station 's best the song are all great and alison share lead vocal with adam dan and ron which give the album variety there is also an instrumental the traditional quot little liza jane quot which move along at break neck speed bluegrass at it finest this album though ha a variety of song besides bluegrass including country pop and inspirational the 20 page booklet contains all lyric and lot of photo of alison and the band highly recommended 

when i wa a child open up a lot of door this is the lyric to quot no place to hide quot feature adam steffey union station lead vocal and on the mandolin is a key part of the success of alison krauss amp union station along with dan tyminski vocal guitar ron block vocal banjo guitar barry bale vocal acoustic bass upright bass this group of young talented musician ha taken the country by storm many people have taken another look at mountain music also known a bluegrass the gathering of new and old fan is staggering almost phenomenal to say the least much of this is due to their participation in the overnight hit of quot o brother where art thou quot a we watched the country music award it ran away with best album and dan tyminski walked away with his prize alison krauss share her love and talent with every member of union station you can hear it on every track just listen to quot find my way back to my heart quot touching really get to you another is quot i can let go now quot lyric that go deep into your soul quot i'll remember you love in my prayer quot an old time tune and tyminski and fellow player give out with everything that 's in em' and how about quot pain of a troubled life quot composed and performed by ron block sit back and listen take heed friend cause you do n't want to old before your time my highlight pick is quot blue trail of sorrow quot this is what 's it all about toe tapping music from early americana gotta love it total time 48 11 on 14 track rounder record 11661 0365 2 1997 

alison krauss and her union station bandmates do a fine job on so long so wrong alison 's singing and fiddle playing dominate especially on the ballad quot looking in the eye of love quot quot i can let go now quot quot deeper than cry quot quot it doe n't matter quot quot happiness quot and quot there is a reason quot however union station 's guitarist dan tyminski who sings lead on quot no place to hide quot quot the road is a lover quot and quot blue trail of sorrow quot also is a strong singer furthermore adam steffey mandolin ron block banjo and guitar and barry bale acoustic bass the remaining union station member really shine on this one the instrumental quot little liza jane quot on which all the band member get into the act is a driving bluegrass tune there 's no percussion anywhere on the record but thanks to barry 's thumping bass line the song have a rhythmic flowing feel to them which more than make up for the lack of a drumbeat there are n't any musical gimmick here but there is a great bluegrass and folk sound so long so wrong is a fine collection of song from a truly talented group of singer and musician 

this is the real thing folk real singer and real musician making real music blow off shania and faith and buy this and every other alison krauss union station cd available 

ever since elvis began his famed recording career with a rockabilly cover of bluegrass bossman bill monroe 's signature quot blue moon of kentucky quot bluegrass ha been regarded by some a the poor barefoot hayseed step child of country music acoustic guitar and banjo and fiddle were overwhelmed and swallowed up by electric guitar and peddle steel guitar a successful bluegrass album sold maybe 30 000 the quot dirty little secret quot in nashville wa that the bluegrass musician were the one who could really play so talented bluegrassers who wanted to make a decent living became nashville studio musician bluegrass fan who are often a fanatical about the music a a religious zealot is about their religion considered such musician to have quot sold out quot and so it wa that artist like ricky skaggs bill keith marty stuart and vince gill were considered once big fish in the small bluegrass pond they were thought by bluegrass purist to have compromised their artistic integrity to become country success wa it ironic that ricky skagg 's first country hit wa a quot countrified quot version of lester flatt 's quot do n't get above your raisin' quot the purpose of this review is n't to give even a thumbnail history lesson of the evolution of bluegrass and a comparison to more popular and quot mainstream quot form of music but it is important in having a complete appreciation of this album to recognize the historical rarity of a quot popular quot or quot breakout quot bluegrass artist or band or recording in the past half century before alison krauss the number of bluegrass recording which received any degree of popular airplay could be easily counted on one hand flatt and scruggs quot foggy mountain breakdown quot the music used a the musical theme to quot bonnie and clyde quot flatt and scruggs quot the ballad of jed clampett quot the theme to quot beverly hillbilly quot quot dueling banjo quot from the soundtrack to quot deliverance quot quot rocky top quot by the osborne brother quot fox on the run quot by the country gentlementhen along came alison krauss with her stunning crystalline voice that caught the attention of the bluegrass community while she wa still a teenager she recorded several album which were among the most well received in the bluegrass community leading up to 1995 when her label rounder persuaded her to put together a few new recording with mostly previous release some a quot guest star quot on other cd to come up with the compilation quot now that i 've found you quot it may have been called quot greatest hit quot for an artist that had had a quot hit quot that cd stunned everyone sold 6 million copy and suddenly alison krauss wa the hottest female voice in nashville winning a handful of cma award under the expectation of that success m krauss and her band union station went to the studio to record the follow up album many on either side of the quot bluegrass purist quot fence were expecting the next cd to be the quot sell out quot cd full of steel guitar and guest duet with barbra streisand what came instead wa this cd quot so long so wrong quot an album that celebrates the bluegrass heritage that these musician hail from in addition to showcasing the extraordinary contemporary talent of alison and union station newcomer to bluegrass expecting a recording with nothing but alison 's voice were likely put out a little that some guy wa singing the lead vocal on several of these cut alison knew that dan tyminsky wa an extraordinary vocalist year before dan wa chosen to do the singing voiceover for george clooney in quot o brother where art thou quot the cd is one of the prominent one that alison joke about in which her lead vocal are predominantly on beautiful but sorrowful ballad like quot deeper than cry quot and quot find my way back to my heart quot these track are beautiful and they 're not quot straight bluegrass quot for you purist ron block trade in his trusty 5 string for some tasty acoustic guitar work and these are closer to folk or even just quot unplugged pop quot than to bluegrass the dan tyminski track are rollicking rip roaring bluegrass monster like quot i 'll remember you love in my prayer quot and quot the road is a lover quot this cd is one of the very best by alison krauss and union station and that is saying something if you 're a fan of alison or maybe you just heard something about quot those musician on the o brother soundtrack quot this is a recording you just have to add to your collection 

i 've long been a fan of alison krauss and her band union station their brand of contemporary bluegrass is unique and captivating this album is their best work to date superb quality throughout including the instrumentals the title track is irresistable and quot there is a reason quot is rapturous impeccable musicianship and superb recording along with krauss 's unique vocal style and virtuoso fiddle playing combine to make this cd a must have for fan of bluegrass in a word masterful 

allison krauss is truly talented such a beautiful voice this disc ha the best song of all her disc easy listening 

generally speaking you could say that there two side to alison krauss and union station the softer melodic side is usually with alison vocally in front and the faster bluegrass country side which often ha one of the band member on lead vocal though i usually prefer the alison song this two side concept give a fine variation and the fast bluegrass track demonstrate what great musician the union station are among alison 's song which are all great for me the beautiful pop ballad happiness stand out which also ha great harmony vocal by banjoplayer ron block with at least a handful other great pop country ballad written by various songwriter like michael mcdonald and mark simos this is one of my favourite album by the group 

my wife just bought this cd for me from a thrift store for 2 00 i love it i own 2 sacds of allison krauss always wanted more but wa too busy keeping up with other musical artist i love blue grass because of it celtic root american folk history it 's pre country without steel guitar song about truck driving broken heart it 's song about real life religious secular i read many review about this cd most got it right i like to hear allison krauss sing because the male soloist throw me off with the more twangy aspect of blue grass i believe the male singer sound best backing up allison krauss there is more to this cd then blue grass lot of beautiful folk ballad yes the fast song reveal blue grass at it best the slow ballad are a great antithesis a rating of 4 for the male soloist i may need a few spin of the cd to re gear my mind for a rating of a 5 good sound production with allison krauss in the left channel some write that they think the instrument over power the singer but i hear everything maybe it 's their stereo set up 

bottom line all and all so long so wrong is a 3 5 star effort for aku because of the aforementioned vocal track issue despite the fact that alison krauss ha n't the vocal range of most in country western blue grass she ha managed to become the voice of the latter her voice is lithe but with a charm and genuine cadence that is hard to resist hence her success mostly with her band union station in 1995 the band alison krauss union station aku released their seventh album so long so wrong which went on to garner critical acclaim but not very much commercial success a is the band 's style they stayed away from the lavishly produced pseudo c w pop that so mark other group their adopted genre and instead remain fairly close to their bluegrass root but perhaps the cd wa under produced and engineered if there is such a malady most of the album 's vocal track were too quiet i e it wa hard to understand the lyric throughout most of the cd especially when m krauss wa taking lead the especially true on the cd 's title track so long so wrong track no 1 wherein m kruass 's already lithe voice is at point inaudible the same hold true for track no 2 no place to hide track no 3 deeper than cry but to a lesser extent track no 4 i can let go now track no 5 the road is a lover track no 7 it doe n't matter well you get the picture the musicianship wa flawless a usual but the quiet vocal track detracted from my overall enjoyment of the cd that is not to say the entire album is a throwaway because of the vocal shortcoming far from it so long so wrong maintains the band tradition of fine musicianship and crisp clear harmonizing vocal when they can be heard that is and is overall a worthy aku release just not my favorite when krauss is n't spotlighted on center stage her presence is still apparent in the guise of her high soprano harmony and energetic fiddle her ability to blend into the group fade into the body a it were only buttress the sense that aku are indeed a band rather than merely a supporting backdrop for krauss 's solo effort an equaling male vocal cord is struck by guitarist and long time band member dan tyminski who brings more traditional bluegrass sound to the group and ron block who is not the strongest solo vocalist is an excellent song writer and contributed two track to the album track no 11 pain of a troubled mind lead vocal and track no 14 the hauntingly beautiful there is a reason so long so wrong is an ambitious cd there are fourteen vocal track and one instrumental track no 6 little liza jane when released the song were included on a two album set but only one cd all of the member of aku play instrument indeed they are all considered virtuoso the circa 1997 group included alison krauss vocal fiddle violin barry bale acoustic bass ron block banjo guitar vocal adam steffey mandolin and dan tyminski guitar mandolin vocal adam steffey ha since left the group to be replaced by jerry douglas on the dobro all and all so long so wrong is a 3 5 star effort for aku because of the aforementioned vocal track issue the instrumentation on the cd is top notch and more than part of the reason i love this group so much they have such a passion for bluegrass and make this quintessential form of american music swell the soul 

the other reviewer here who gave this cd three star have valid point and i suggest reading them before buying this the vocal are a bit low volume the song in general are a bit melancholy and the style kinda melting pot yet m krauss doe have a voice of distinction and her bandmates are skilled musician not so much vocally for my taste i have n't owned many krauss recording so i ca n't say this is better or worse than her other release if you like bluegrass contemporary country sound and find this at a bargain price pick it up 

if your a fan of this title you better pick up the dvd audio version fast if you can play dvd audio before it 's gone sound fantastic sadly stereo only reason for 4 star but still highly recommended going going gone 

i heard love at the five and dime on the radio wwuh one rainy morning in 1986 on my way to work in hartford nanci 's fresh and honest sound wa literally music to ear accustomed to machine like synth based 80 's rock i immediately went over to integrity 'n music in wethersfield and picked up a copy in vinyl of course that cut plus last of the true believer and more than a whisper proved riveting and honest a few week later in full fanship i caught nanci alone with her guitar and the resident reptile at roaring brook nature center singing many of these same song later her divorce and political stridency soured her music and furrowed her brow her subsequent work wa packed with beauty but she never again scaled these peak of pure simplicity and romance 

this is the early folkie nanci griffith i always thought she should have been a major star but then when she got on a major lable they did n't know what to do with her her early music is the best of her career and this is one of her early release with three really good song lookin' for the time the last of the true believer and goin' gone goin' gone became a big hit for kathy mattea a did love at the five and dime which is also on here i also felt she should have been a major song writer a a woman i would put her right up there with matraca berg and deborah allen but for whatever reason those two song and outbound plane by suzy bogguss are the only song that i know that she wrote that were hit this is n't a bad cd it just seems like for whatever reason she just never lived up to what she could have been and it seems like she did n't really care 

this is some of her very early work great music i love this woman 's work any of her album are well worth buying 

never did i ever think i 'd be listening to a female vocalist that ha the sound in her voice i 'd been looking for the past 2 decade 20 year too earlythis sound like today but it wa yesterday one of her best worksevery song is a jewelafter buying it once i 'd buy it againa definite must have 

the thing that stand out the most to me about this masterpiece is how the synthesizer and guitar are given equal importance and blend perfectly together the only other 80 's new wave band that i can think of that pulled this off is duran duran rio so if you love the sound of guitar and synthesizer together this album is for you a pleasure all the way through 

over the year i 've heard so much about different version of this album and that the 5 06 version with the space intro on the original u cd pressing is not the original album version well do n't expect to find that other version here because the new reissue us the 5 06 version but you can find the other version on the cd then 80 totally oldie volume 5 but back to this cd the first noticeable difference from my original u pressing is that the song order is changed slightly maybe comparable to one of the european release of the album personally i felt having the space intro version of i ran first wa a very effective way to begin the album but no biggie that 's what programing cd player is for the real treasure here are the bonus track including the awesomely afos track tokyo and pick me up plus you get tanglimara which wa already a bonus track on the reissue of the album listen so not sure why they had to include it again on another reissue truth be told the cd only run about 55 minute so they really could have included the original version of i ran without the space intro and with the cold end a a bonus track which would have been the only way to really make this reissue even better 

future generation probably will not get it but this album wa a revolution goofy hair and all afos wa making the music of the future in the 80 and there is n't a bad song on this disk space age love song is a perfect song absolutely perfect 

this is a great album trust me and what no one seems to remember is that these guy are grammy winner yes grammy winner for best instrumental of the year for the fantastic d n a from this their debut album this is a classic example of a band whose image wa so strong who can forget that hair that it often overshadowed their talent another fine example is culture club unfortunately it wa all downhill from here a their popularity not to mention their creativity and their stability quickly waned very upbeat energetic dance pop rock with just enough synths and effect to make it stand out in the crowd my advice skip the many best of compilation and go straight to this one and when you get ridiculed for playing it just like you did in high school you know who you are do the flock proud and wear that freak badge with honor 

self titled album that came out in 1982 1 space age love songawesome futuristic song about a guy falling for a girl2 you can rundrums and guitar riff rule this you ca n't run from yourself 3 do n't ask mea strange song about saucer 4 messagesit 's what it say 5 telecommunicationa repetitive dance song 6 modern love is automaticeerie guitar riff and hypnotic beat tell this story of love in the future age 7 standing in the doorwaya groovy beat telling the story of a man spying on someone 8 d n a an instrumental track featuring synthesizer and guitar 9 i ran so far away the song that they are best known for 10 man madethis album is awesome favorite song are space age love song i ran you can run d n a modern love and message check it out i ran is good but there is more song wise to a flock of seagull thanthat 

i did n't know that this album wa remastered until recently and it sold out so i had to order from amazon uk this is one of my favorite new wave album it 's one of those record i never really get tired of there is only one weak song imo you can run but even that one is n't so bad the album ha a nice mix of guitar and synthesizer the classic i ran is here along with other favorite like space age love song message dna and telecommunication i 've always liked standing in the doorway a lot too the remastered sound is very good just listen to the drum kick in on dna the original version of the cd i have is only 10 track and is in a different sequence here we get tokyo added on which is good because it wa previously hard to find i'm guessing this may have been the way the uk version wa made they should 've included the shorter version of i ran a a bonus but i 've always thought the longer one wa better anyway the bonus track are good especially window which is the best of them the booklet ha been expanded which is really nice it includes lyric to most of the song and some interesting liner note by a long time fan another great release by this company which also did the great kim wilde remasters the other 2 afos album with the original line up are also available remastered their other album after those are really more for hardcore fan if you love new wave get this one it 's a must have if you love rock and synth music 

the debut album a flock of seagull is a riveting work by a band who truly strove to craft a music for the age mike score along with his brother ali paul reynolds and frank maudsley had made an album of substance style and wit truly the bane of anything mtv wanted to promote which is why their fortune quickly waned in the u the cd reissue is identical to the vinyl with just one small complaint why did jive record have to take the intro off of the live b side version of i ran found on the 45 of it 's not me talking and tack it onto the studio version of the song blasphemous i had the good fortune of seeing the band at radio city in ny in august of 1983 and they did indeed rock the house 

lately i 'd been thinking about performer who had one album in their career that wa so good it eclipsed everything else they did rendering even greatest hit album irrelevant the first band i think of in that regard is a flock of seagull this first album is better than many of their peers' greatest hit collection for that matter i 'd put in on the shortlist of best debut ever in this era of cherry picking just the memorable mp3s from an album this is one of those album that should just be downloaded a a whole oh i could do without the two instrumentals that close the album it doe n't matter to me that dna won a grammy but just about every other song here would rate at least an 8 on a scale of 10 particular highlight are message which for my taste wa one of the defining song of 1982 and the best thing a flock of seagull ever recorded standing in the doorway and modern love is automatic over the year a flock of seagull ha endured a lot of ridicule for being supremely 80 in their fashion sense but such envy is just an attempt to distract the listener from the fact that those criticizing the band never came close to putting out an album this good 

a fantastic debut and rather sadly the best the group ever came to release song on the album do n't have a glitch throughout in comparison this studio effort outperforms most every greatest hit cd the typical techno pop band ha available on the market today the cut i ran their breakthrough top10 hit space age love song you can run message telecommunication modern love is automatic and d n a are among the song i likely have best appreciated over their career what wa especially great about the group i felt and still do is that it did n't rely entirely on synthesized effect s the band member knew the difference between their singing songwriting and whatever the talent synthesizer then had to offer during the early 80 's listener fortunate enough to experience their sound witnessed something no technically advanced counterpart or rival have since come to surpass if you did n't get the chance like i myself got back then to be introduced to this band 's music or if your ear were simply not much smaller than your foot buying this now cd i'm convinced would be a decision you would n't regret and an addition invaluable to your set a time passed on god bless all free nation who have allowed inspired such this human musical creativity to evolve 

when i ran hit the radio chart i knew music wa changing for the eighty i had to run out and buy this album right away it 's not so much the hit record of i ran that make this album great it 's all that electronic experimentation also psychedelic that make this album so cherishable each track had an interesting opening that did n't just start a song but it created an otherworldly effect that made you forget that this is just another pop album the secondary hit from this album is the second song space age love song which i think should have probably been released a a single first because it sounded very similar to i ran but still lacked that hook that separated it from the other new new wave techno star of the eighty if i ran wa the second released single then maybe a flock of seagull would be embraced more give people a small taste first and then deliver the best piece of the pie my favorite track after i ran is the last track called man made it ha that seventy techno progressive ambient feel to it after this album their next album called listen had a great track called wishing i had a photograph of you which wa great but their best of album that got released a couple year later gave u a better nine minute version where their instrumentation talent were once again allowed to be expressed aggressively on listen there are a few dark instrumental track that would make you feel like this could not possibly be a flock of seagull i have them both a flock of seagull is a very underrated eighty group and i ca n't believe that this cd is already out of print it 's worth looking for basically just like gary numan depeche mode the buggles yello even the later rush album and many other artist sounded like they all had one major influence to what became new wave in the eighty i think their greatest influence wa kraftwerk 

i 've always had a lot of respect for a flock of seagull these guy have written interesting and catchy music with imagination i like the way they combine the keyboard and guitar playing each instrument complement the other quite nicely this debut album from a flock of seagull is very solid and energetic it 's in a new wave synth pop direction with an equal dose of guitar playing all ten of the track are satisfying the album 's musicianship songwriting and production are good my favorite tune are quot i ran quot quot space age love song quot and quot d n a quot quot space age lovesong quot is my favorite song from a flock of seagull that tune ha imagination and catchiness all rolled into one mike score 's vocal really soar on it it 's truly a well written song mike score doe a nice job with the vocal throughout the album his voice is effective and unique quot d n a quot happens to be a very impressive instrumental paul reynolds' guitar work on it is really good quot i ran quot is also a cool and memorable tune quot modern love is automatic quot ha an interesting intro this album ha both futuristic and imaginative quality it 's worth a listen 

and we just got mtv in my home i think it wa may i wa immediately transfixed by the new music video channel prior to my budding interest in new wave music which started a couple year before i spent the 1970 's listening to kiss and considering the lyrical content of just about every kiss song i can see why it appealed to me a a pre teen it 's beyond juvenile but now it wa time to grow up and listen to song about spaceship and alien with band looking the part enter a flock of seagull from the first time i saw the video for 'i ran' i wa hooked the song wa and still is awesome the band looked odd and cool and i had to have the lp so a i often did at that age i cleaned the house to earn the 6 99 to buy the album from my local record store thankfully they had one misplaced copy and i got it it turned out to be a great year for music and i'm not just talking single the bulk of most new wave lp 's released in the early 80 's were often very good and this album wa a prime example i remember the first time i heard the instantly memorable and catchy 'telecommunication' i had to play it again the sound that stood out most to me on the album wa paul reynolds' very distinctive guitar his classic guitar riff rule energetic timepiece like 'you can run' and 'modern love is automatic' i could n't get enough of this band at the time and even remember the world premiere of their new video 'space age love song' the band were hot at the time but it wa a shame to have them viewed a a joke in the musically miserable 90 's thankfully appreciation for the band a true individual ha remained and even increased over time i 've never been ashamed to admit to being a fan even when people were drowning themselves in dreck like nirvana and pearl jam back in those grey day this latest cd edition is remastered entirely from original studio master tape and sound dramatically improved over previous cd release you also get essential bonus track 'windows' may be my personal favorite afos song it got a strangely catchy melancholy to it 'pick me up' make it first cd appearance on this edition and is just a catchy a some of the better album track a flock of seagull would go on to release two more very strong album listen 1983 and the story of a young heart 1984 before falling apart when paul reynolds wa out of the band it wa over i loved seeing them back together year ago in the vh1 episode of band reunited and it looked a if everyone truly enjoyed themselves unfortunately by the time the tour made it to my area advertised a the original band it wa back to being mike score and his alternate band it would have been a dream come true pun intended regarding their lackluster 1986 album to have seen my first mtv love in their original incarnation say what you want about the hairdo afos released some amazing music during their heyday go on admit it all you metal and grunge fan you always had a secret soft spot for a flock of seagull 

call the lyric dumb all you want they are more interesting than 1 000 band trying to search their lost soul news flash there is no such thing a a soul keep looking for love and ufo 's and let u know your fascination with modern life i love the guitar sound and the hook make your album the best this and 2 are the classic what happened to make you so dull after that remember david wa one of your best song and suicide day wa good but the rest of the third album even the tile track wa boring two classic ai n't bad get this one right away 

kr seemed more focused than ever here during the making of this album scott la rock dj and producer of bdp wa shot and killed during the making of my philosophy in fact which in my opinion is when kris started showing his true color it wa positive and negative educational and entertaining which had become the mantra of kr ever since on this album he tell you that illegal business control america he tell you how sometimes love is gonna get you on this album you learn what the word unrational mean 

i ca n't believe i slept on this record up until a week ago the only other bdp record i had before this one wa 1987 's criminal minded which is one of the most brilliant and groundbreaking album ever made but i'm beginning to think that kr one 's sophomore effort by all mean necessary is just a influential the murder of dj scott la rock had a profound effect on kr one which is very apparent in his engrossing lyrical flow this record feel more personal and much more concise and in the eye of many critic including myself this is kr one 's finest moment until now i never knew that i 've heard kr one 's vocal sampled on so many other hip hop album i own not only sample but covered chorus signature time flow and of course the beat every emcee ha been vastly influenced by kr one underground and mainstream check out the first song my philosophy if you 're an avid hip hop listener you 've probably heard these line sampled many time right up to your face and dis you or it 's not about a salary it 's all about reality check out that cut up deep purple riff smoke on the water on ya slippin along with the familiar sample bring it back that old new york rap i wa also shocked by the chorus on stop the violence 1 2 3 the crew is called bdp and if you want to go to the tip top stop the violence in hip hop wyahhhh or the how about the cover of that chorus by mo def talib kweli black star 1 2 3 mo def talib kweli we came to rock it on to the tip top best alliance in hip hop wyahhhh the teacher is also in full effect on song like illegal business the often sampled i'm still no 1 is also one of my favorite it 's hard to deny that he 's the best i also enjoyed jimmy quite a bit where we here a reference to one of my personal favorite jungle brother tune jimbrowski all in all i'm ashamed that i referred to myself a a hip hop fan before i got a hold of this record it 's so good it 's sick you can bet that i 'll be checking out his solo career after after hearing this example of hip hop perfection 

this track alone is worth 5 star the rest of the album is ok but believe me when you listen to the track and how it applies to today illusion of hip hop it amazing how this 20yr old track is still kicking knowledge before you were in diaper a must have for all hip hop enthusiast 

this one is dope and that cover is dope too lol overall a good kr album good for those time when you want that old school vibe in your headphone 

there is n't much to say about a certified classic boogie down production wa always on the pulse of conscious rap that 's why by all mean necessary stood out a one of the most dynamic album in rap music at the time other group like public enemy and x clan were more unabashed in their delivery kr one had a vision of entertaining a well a educating their listening audience throw on a song like jimmy where the beat and the mood are both playful but kr one doe n't joke around when he 's telling everybody to strap up and protect themselves when jumping in the bed a a 12 year old boy listening to this record for the first time i knew there wa more to the material being discussed on this song and would eventually learn what he wa truly talking about in later year other song like still number 1 and my philosophy are the other standouts on this album but the fact is that the style and sound of bdp made them stand out from the rest the rock 'n roll edge of ya slippin wa a risky move at that time considering most rapper rapped over old r b sample or drum beat only the caribbean groove of stop the violence and the uptempo groove of t cha t cha are other example of going against the grain criminal minded is always the first album people blurt out a their favorite bdp album but once his brother scott larock wa murdered by all mean necessary unearthed the conscious mind of kr one if you consider yourself a true hip hop fan then you already know all of this to be true but if you 've missed a few album during your lifetime you should definitely complete your hip hop collection with this album by all mean necessary 

krsone bdp doe it again didn't think he could come better than criminal minded but you know what he did track 1 through track 10 all classic show versitile style on a higher level the teacher teach but is deeper than the average professor consistent with the first album lyric are banging beat are banging if you do not have this album you are missing what so many rapper are tring to accomplise but they fail check this album out and you will understand what lyrical flexiblilty is all about no one doe it better krsone is the greatest 

good album from one of the more prominent old school rapper who is still around 

by all mean necessary fresh for 1988 you sucker wa the signature line from my philosophy the first single off boogie down productions' masterpiece second lp by all mean necessary in the interim between their debut on 1987 's criminal minded and the summer release of by all mean founding member dj scott la rock wa tragically murdered frontman kr one soldiered on bringing junior member d nice and kr 's brother kenny parker into the mix a turntable operator produced by the artist and engineered by ivan doc rodriguez kr one maintains the momentum of criminal minded with streetwise battle rap but he incorporates more narrative about ghetto lifestyle and the danger of street violence the lyric to i'm still 1 are loosely based on a rhyme contest between kr and rap legend melle mel at nyc 's latin quarter illegal business dismisses the easy target of the war on drug policy making the point that the illegal drug trade is not divorced from the american economy jimmy make a case for safe sex and could be considered a sequel to super hoe the reggae shuffle of stop the violence of course feature the unforgettable hook 1 2 3 the crew is called bdp and if you want to go to the tip top stop the violence in hip hop why oh the most surprisingly enjoyable song is ya slippin' so assume you 're doomed when you step in the room i 'll be the witch and you 'll be the broom taunt kr a he rhyme over deep purple 's smoke on the water guitar riff combined with his own slowed down poetry rhythm track necessary is a sonically sparse nod to spoken word poetry at the end of the lp a first for rap album this album could be re released with remixes such a an alternate take of i'm still 1 and perhaps even a drum bass remix of necessary that surfaced in the late 90 's 

this is a classic cd period kr 1 is a living legend and this is him at his prime song like my philosophy illegal business stop the violence and still 1 are some of the most quoted sampled in the last 20 year of hip hop if you think you do n't know anything by kr 1 one listen of this cd would prove you wrong the list of rapper who have sampled or quoted song on this cd is inexhaustible this wa big when it came out in 88 and it sound just a fresh today this is a gem among diamond a true hip hop classic even in scott la rock 's absence the production is stellar the lyric are top notch a close to a perfect hip hop record a possible 

when you mention hip hop to somebody the name kr 1 should come up when you mention the most impressive lp 's by all mean necessary should be mentioned immediately everything you want from a dope mc philosophy storytellin battle rap you name it it found here cop it now 

many have heard of the passing of dj scott la rock but somehow his sidekick kr one manage to still hold it down and still bring out another classic album under the name of bdp following criminal minded with 10 track of highly concentrated molecule in the form of by all mean necessary kr still kept his rhyme a fresh a they could get from my philosophy to necessary the record introduced kr one a the peaceful teacher and foreshadowing his gift for contradiction the album cover may be very familiar to the famous shoot of malcolm x with a gun in his hand but song like illegal business jimmy and stop the violence dropped science on drug sex and violence with such a powerful voice and untouchable lyric kr one made u all believe his boast that bdp would be here forever best moment my philosophy ya slippin' and jimmy 

it would be easy to assume a many people probably did that after the death of long time partner scott larock kr one would fall off however he gave all those critic a fat smack in the face with the release of by all mean necessary although it 's not quite a great a criminal minded few are it is definetly a worthy album and is an example of some of the best rap to come out of the bronx my philosophy the semi sequel to the first track on criminal minded poetry a great track surpasses it predecessor which is not an easy feat and is arguably the best hip hop song of all time add 9 other great track and i 'd say you have an essential album 

this wa when you had to be saying something in rap to get true respect and kr one is one of the greatest teacher the world of rap ha ever known you got more black history from his record than from most classroom put together his lyrical flow amp word hit home the malcolm x take wa something refreshing amp much needed he did n't pull no punch here i miss those day 

by all mean necessary showcase kr one at his best he is definitely one of the greatest mc 's of all time and the material here should tell you why quot my philosophy quot is one of my favorite hip hop song of all time kr talk about the state of hip hop the past of bdp and their future on track like quot illegal business quot quot stop the violence quot and the spoken word track quot necessary quot kr speaks about political issue while he display his mcing skill on the classic quot i'm still 1 quot and kris take the jungle brother 's quot jimbrowski quot one step further on quot jimmy quot from start to finish by all mean necessary is a great album if you are a hip hop fan you must own this 

this album is why i still listen to kr 1 today if i saw this cd in the store i would get it lot of intelligent and conscious lyric and he doe n't hold back i like quot stop the violence quot and it rumbling sound i still like quot my philosophy quot quot i'm still 1 quot quot jimmy quot and many others but i like on quot illegal business quot where they sample some music that i remembered hearing on fat albert and the cosby kid bill cosby 's show he mention his friend scott la rock many time over the album this is his best effort to me while i like his later one this is the best 

this is classic 80 's hip hop at this time kr wa god this album came out when i wa 15 and is probably even more relavent today because hip hop ha died a thousand death already for real hip hop pick this up 

there is no doubt in any true hip hop fan 's mind that kr 1 may be the best mc of all time and this album just back that theory up originally recorded after the death of his boogie down production partner scott larock kr decided to pay tribute to his lost friend by all mean necessarry hence the name of the album this is a true hip hop classic and one of the most influential album of all time a must have for any hip hop or music fan 1 my philosophy 10 10 awesome a hip hop classic 2 ya slippin' 10 10 my favorite track on the album unbelivable hip hop at it 's finest 3 stop the violence 10 10 probably the most influential bdp song out there great beat and infamous hook classic 4 illegal business 10 10 one of the most funky and catchy hook from kr plus some pretty amazing lyric and funny fat albert sample 5 nervous 9 10 just a bunch of talking over a beat but the beat is tight a hell so it carry the whole damn song 6 i'm still number one 10 10 nice flow by kr on this one and a pretty tight snare beat too plus many see this track a the one that prof he is the number one 7 part time sucker 10 10 tight track with some pretty tight snare just plain good 8 jimmy 10 10 awesome song wif a catchy a mess hook and some pretty cool and creative lyric about safe sex 9 t'cha t'cha 10 10 nice flow from kr and a pretty tight hook 10 necessary 10 10 even though it a talking track it 's still a really good and true look at hip hop music overall this cd is awesome get this cd by all mean necessary no pun intended 

fresh for 1988 you sucker how many people can forget that line if you do n't know it you do n't have the album so what are you waiting for buy it best track quot my philosophy quot quot i'm still 1 quot quot illegal business quot and the most hard rocking track is quot ya slippin quot which hijack deep purple 's quot smoke on the water quot guitar riff and turn it into a hardcore hip hop battle rampage kr doe a nod to spoken word poetry at the end a first for rap album quot see how it sound a little un rational a lot of mc 's like to use the word 'dramatical' quot classic material an ya know it 

another banger from one of the greatest year in hiphop 1988 kris drop science like no other on this one this still bang today almost 20 year later i ca n't wait till kris say fresh for 2008 you suckaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssss 

kr one is another one of those mc on a short list of them whose second album completely took the first by all mean necessary wa excellent a he just like public enemy did in 88 brought a conscious and more political state of awareness to hip hop this album represents kr in his true form and it show on every song here 's the review album highlight every song is worth a listen production thumb up lyric and subject mattere thumb up other than public enemy who else wa coming this political in 88 originality thumb up the last word this wa a great moment for hip hop music kr one came back in 88 for this second album and he did n't disappoint if hip hop wa still like this today it would be so much better one can only hope overall i strongly recommend this album to any fan of hip hop if you 're into politically charged hip hop 

but this joint is pretty solid got kind of an old school vibe to it because it old probably freaky tale and dope fiend beat are the two highlight here 

i 've been wanting this album and i finally got it i understand that too short say inappropriate lyric in this record but this is for entertainment for grown ups not appropriate for kid though when i first heard the single freaky tale in appearance in the movie the wood i wa hit when i heard that song it appears when the blood gang are crushing and smoking i wanted to know who wa the artist to the song and i finally found out and i wanted to get this album and i finally got warning not appropriate for kid 

too short is the ultimate pimp if you like this album check out smoke session vol 1 from his homie devin the dude another 5 star 

this is hort 's first album this is where he defines himself a the pimp player mack daddy of oak town ca it 's because of hort dog 's early work that the yay is on the hip hop map and this is the album that started it all the production on this album is hella tight the beat are bumpin' and the bass is just boomin' even on my stock stereo the whole car be rattlin' the lyric are classic hort who can forget freaky tale this is just 8 minute of pure pimpin' in addition mack attack you know what i mean and little girl are just tha shiznit this is arguably hort 's best album this is a definite must have for any hip hop collection old school yay area sound all the way you know 

too short 's career ha been spit upon by supposedly `real hip hop fans' those fan are stupid people because they do n't realize short 's influence on the rap game and hip hop music in general he basically started this pimp player rhyme and flow he 's hated on for his flow lyrical content woman bashing etc etc his beat are slow ride out beat made for a car too short is an underated storyteller a well sex story have never sounded better than a too short rhyme although he released a series of tape out the trunk this is his first `official' album 1988 freaky tale the beat wa so playalistic and the rhyme were on pizoint this song wa the joint when it came out forget what you heard this song really got me into hip hop music it is indescribably tight 10 minute of pure trillness bliss other song that were tight were mack attack dope fiend beat little girl although the album is only 8 song the average length of each song is 5 6 minute leaving plenty to digest although the album rarely get any more spin from me because of his newer album having better beat and rhyme and his constant innovation check the yo neck yo back remix for sonic brilliance if ya do n't know this is still an essential album for any serious hip hop cd collector a must have 

this is where it all started every gangsta rapper know where credit is do with out this album there would be no 40 snoop or dog pound there 's just a few song on this album but there very long most avg over 5 min this is short 's first album and he will always be highly touted for born to mack the slow lazy high pitch flow that he give on this album can never be duplicated all the music wa produced by short the beat are extremly heavy based and simple with a good melody the hit song on this album is freaky tale which is almost 10min long short come into his own a a mack daddy and pave the way for all future gangster rapper in the 90 's and up this album wa made 1984 and still sound great even today not sounding out of date p s checkout dope fiend beat that 's my favorite 

the oakland mack is back again with another 4 5 star album this is the 15th album of hort 's i have and all his album from 1988 1995 are 5 star classic or 4 5 star great album his 1996 album is my least favorite and worht 3 then he came back in 1999 and 2000 with 4 5 star ralbums and every one since 2001 is probably 3 5 star but back to this one this is classic old school hort dog 7 long dirty x rated song over deep bass funky sounding beat with no guest of the 7 song 1 is ok 1 is a classic 2 are almost classic ad the other 3 are good production is great a well like on all his older album ha the great funk sound to it not the sown south crunk style he work with now a must have album from a true pioneer in the rap game 1 8 2 8 5 good beat 3 8 5 4 7 5 9 5 tight beat with 9 minute of his freaky tale 6 9 5 another tight beat and dirty song 7 10 classic about little girl over a great beat todd shaw b 4 29 66 b los angeles ca moved to oakland cacheck all my review 

classic album many classic album dropped around this time straight outta compton no one can do it better boomin word from hell great adventure of slick rick paid in full etc too hort is very underrated rapper and this is one of his finest work his beat are just incredible in song such a mack attack there are some nice instrumental part to the song which show off how good the beat is his storytelling is incredible one of the greatest storytelling mc 's ever bottom line is get this album if u havent already it a timeless classic all track are the best but my favorite is mack attack 

many of y'all might think that born to mack which wa released in the late 80 's is hella old and too hort 's start at this rap sh well you could n't be more wrong too short started rapping and releasing record even earlier in the earlier 80 's he 's over 20 year in the game anyway in the mid late 80 's since he wa big in oakland and the whole bay area jive record signed too hort to a big contract which made too short huge and also added quite a few million to his bank account throughout the year born to mack wa too hort 's first album on jive it wa released nationwide and quickly became gold too hort presented to the rap world something that they had n't seen before the pimp game too hort wa the first one to rap about pimpin' mackin' the first one to come out with nasty a rhyme about those ho s one of the first playas all those sucker wanna be a pimp like 50 cent snoop dogg etc act like they are some big time pimp but too hort wa and still is the real thing coming from oakland home of the mack short dog is first a pimp then a rapper in many way this music wa innovative musically some of the beat like on dopefiend beat sounded very futuristic at that time and defined the bay area sound so popular today too hort is hella young on this album and you can see yet his flow is on point like it always is his lyric captivating and his storytelling skill undeniable add to this formula charisma a huge ego and a great sense of humor and you get the total package you know the classic off this album mack attack freak tale and dopefiend beat but the rest of it is extra dope too this album symbolizes the beginning of an era too hort is the one who started this pimp playa sh and he is together with nwa and ice t one of the first rapper to put the west coast on the map a true pioneer in this rap game this album is a must have to any rap fan 's collection it 's the beginning listen to this album and see where it all started 

i remember having to go to flea market to get this tap straight underground record but it wa worth it 

got my order in today and i feel great brand new and in 1 week the album came in added to my cd collection and i'm like addicted and obsessed with collecting classic real rap cd ima continue collecting old school rap cd 

after emerging from the underground scene of the bay area too short come back with his mainstream sophomore effort life is too short unfortunately this contains only the clean song not the original release this version also contains a few song from the debut album born to mack the title track lead this album off with positivity and a message he incorporates funk guitar lick over deep bass kick and key to match production effort rhyme and mack attack uptempo track showcasing sir too short 's flow a he spit constant without any hook or chorus to clear rumour i ai n't trippin' clear the air a short give a brief history of his quest to stardom now that i established one fact i came here to rap a punchline found on nobody doe it better a he claim his position a a pioneer oakland is a mainstream r b groove that 's more like an instrumental interlude no he doe not rap or flow on this song but he doe calmly take u on a ride in a cadillac barritz on true and vogue with the top down feeling the breeze representing east oakland like no other city of dope edited version is the darker side of the city street most would ignore too short because of his favoriate word but these track show his versitility and ha a statement produced written performed and mixed by the artist with little help personalised this lp a you can feel the sense of pride taken for his release and this one is no let down too short still do n't stop that rap 

too hort 's life is too hort wa such an influential album when it came out in the 80 's too hort wa n't a great rapper in term of delivery but the beat the groove and his lyric were all amazing and new he essentially created the slow rap genre this is definitely an extremely groovy album that make for good background music a well you could practically play this for anyone and they 'd probably like it a lot the beat may not be a heavy hitting a some other rapper but they 're still really good simple but effective too hort ha a very simple delivery which give him an odd charm he make it seem like anybody can rap the other great thing about him is his lyric which are always fun to listen to but are n't necessarily about much he somehow manages to catch your attention really well overall this is just a really original and different rap album it 's historical influence definitely add to it rating i do n't think mainstream rap fan will like it but those with an open mind will like it a lot highly recommended highlight include the entire album 

too short is teh ultimate pimp if you liek this album check out smoke session vol 1 from his homie devin the dude another 5 star 

after he finally got a major label deal after rappin on the underground for year too hort brings a tight follow up to born to mack the only hort album i do n't have that he released from 1988 on like all his earlier album the beat are tight and funky and the album is very tight which he ha n't put out a 4 star album sice 2000 like all his earlier album the song count is short only 9 but the majority are 5 minute plus over some funky beat that hort provided on all song with help from al eaton on 2 or 3 it ha 1 classic 1 i skip 3 ar eok and the rest are good or real good song guest are on 1 song and do the hook on 1 so like most of his pre retirement album you get a lot of hort dog a must have album 1 9 tight beat 2 8 3 7 5 beat is tight but i ai n't really feelin' his rap style on this one 4 7 5 5 5 6 7 5 f danger zone rappin' 4 tay tight beat 7 8 5 good beat 8 8 5 nice beat 9 10 classic over a great beat todd shaw b 4 29 66 b los angeles ca moved to oakland cacheck all my review 

not bad still ok too here it again too short is one of those rapper who never get old good 

this is hort dog 's best album without doubt all his album are classic but this one sits on the top this is old skool rap at it best with the beat and his lyric at top notch my favorite song are cusswords i ai n't trippin' pimp the ho and do n't fight the feelin' cusswords go for almost 8 minute and not at one point in the song do u get sick of it amazing lyric and the beat is just off the chain i ai n't trippin' ha one of my favorite beat just classic this album is just completely dope and prof he is the real pimp not these wanna be faker such a 50 cent 50 cent aint no pimp but it obvious his idol wa hort dog get this album if u havent already and if u into modern commercial crap then u should pick this up too and see who the real pimp is 

this is too hort 's second album on jive record it wa released in 1988 and it wa right away a huge success in fact it wa the first bay area rap album to sell a million copy it sold more than a million like many of too short 's later album it is a real rap classic with too hort once again spitting nothing but mack game all over the album ask any true west coast rap fan about song like i ai n't trippin' the classic cut do n't fight the feeling the hard hitting cusswords or the pimp anthem pimp tha hoe and you 'll see what i mean the album is timeless never mind it 's from about 13 year ago it 's tight every time i listen to it good music never really get old the album wa way ahead of it 's time in the late 80 's no other rapper wa talkin' about pimpin' unlike these day where any sucka wanna be playa claim he 's a pimp and musically the album impress too it 's a must have period 

this is a great album it is a classic and ha some of too hort 's best song of all time the beat are perfect so are the lyric great album 

they are still playing this and they probably will be 10 year down the line after people listen to all the x 's the kid 's the busta 's and all those thousand of cd from the south they usually come back to too hort 'cause he wa the first and is the best of them all i mean playa for playa for mine quot do n't fight the feelin' quot beat anything that 's coming outta puffy 's present day camp 

musically billy ocean had a career spanning back to the mid 70 's that covered a very captivating and diverse creative ground with his good look obviously well tailored appearance and strong distinctive singing and songwriting the man wa poised to be a huge presence on the pop chart but up until this time only the albumnights feel like getting down his debit album for epic record really made a huge impact at least on the dance side when it came to this his debut on jive record thing started to turn around for him at this particular respect considering his sound wa always in the pop arena but never exactly what you 'd call out and out commercial it wa a bit surprising that this big splashy hit parade intended to be highly commercial still ha such musical value caribbean queen wa ocean 's breakthrough number a slinky grooving dance funk classic that is among my favorite such track of the year mystery lady syncopation and lucky man are deep slow grooving and slick funky number with some bubbly bass guitar lick and keep that flavor going strong the two ballad here the beatles the long and winding road and the title song are both very passionate really and i especially like the way ocean turn the harmony of the vocal around on the beatle cover loverboy is really a unique cut a mixture of 80 's hard guitar rock and synth bass type funk that surprised me in term of the song that become hit dancefloor and if i should lose you seem to be dated to some people musically but they provide a wonderful example of the boogie funk sound still going strong at the time on this album billy ocean managed to get that big hit album that tended to be needed for mass popularity in the 80 's without compromising the integrity of his sound very much the music is primarility based in uptempo material which is rather unconventional for the time to make it even better that uptempo music is funk at it 's root and the bass guitar and rhythm are a emphasized a the singer on that end of it the electronics used are done so sparingly and go along well the song it doe n't sound anything like billy ocean previous two album for epic but despite how often some of these hit are played it did n't really sell out his soul a good example of an artist being themselves a they achieve well deserved popular acclaim 

here is the beginning of billy ocean 's consecutive hit making four hit from this album include the title track loverboy caribbean queen no more love on the run and mystery lady another memorable song is a cover of the beatles' recording the long and winding road before ocean peter frampton covered the hit for the 1978 movie soundtrack sgt pepper's lonely heart club band the other song are great 

billy ocean fused r amp b soul with pop rock and ended up with an excellent album quot carribean queen quot and quot loverboy quot are both must have 80 's hit and this album is the best place to hear them because the version here are much longer than the radio edits on his greatest hit cd but then again every song on this album is great and the heartfelt cover of the beatles' quot long and winding road quot should win over people who do n't normally appreciate 80 's music but if you are a fan of the 80 's you definitely need this album and if you are n't get it anyway 

truth be known i 'd probably keep this over his hit disc i say that because three of his absolute best song are here in their original form and some of his other hit border on cheese plus there 's other good stuff here too caribbean queen no more love on the run wa a huge hit a wa the ballad suddenly and i think my favorite is easily loverboy plus this ha the minor hit mystery lady and a decent cover of the long and winding road that 's over half the album and the remaining four song i 'd call good filler any fan of 80 's pop soul should consider this a must own 

billy ocean delivered here and showed the world that he wa out there and already performing the star aligned for this offering and what a powerhouse my album for my time in africa in the 80 

this wa on tv all the time to promote carribean queen a an 80 classic i had never heard the song in it entirety and it clocked in at just above 7 minute long loverboy and suddenly are also good song but not enough for me to rate it higher than a disappointment with the artist a a whole this is another one of those cd i found at wal mart for 5 buck i guess they 're still trying to make their money back from the first press did n't even include credit and no lyric in the package 

after recording several critically acclaimed album for the gto and epic label that did not exactly set the world on fire billy ocean signed with jive record and hooked up with producer keith diamond who masterminded this classic 1984 release that made billy ocean a true superstar the uptempo dance number 34 caribbean queen no more love on the run 34 34 lover boy 34 and 34 mystery lady 34 all became huge hit but the title track wa and is one of the most gorgeous ballad of it time and one which you can still regularly hear on adult contemporary station throughout the country 

after peaking at number 22 in 1976 with his first hit love really hurt without you billy ocean spent the better part of next eight year in near obscurity until he burst back on the scene with the number one hit caribbean queen no more love on the run it is an all time great 80 's hit with a slinky dance groove it wa followed up by loverboy which wa written by rock producer mutt lange and topped out at number two it ha a slick rock guitar crunch over a danceable beat the title track is a 180 from the first two track a it is a straight syrupy ballad that soared up to number four on the chart the album peaked at number 9 and marked the start of mr ocean 's brief run a the one of the biggest singer in the world 

like 1984 's suddenly and 1986 's love zone this album released in february 1988 spawned four hit they are the title track the love ballad the color of love and here's to you and the powerful sounding get outta my dream get into my car the other song are good i like stand and deliver also i never saw the 1988 film starring lou diamond phillips so i do n't know if that song appeared in the film the other song are great billy ocean put out a dozen hit in the five year period in which this album and the two predecessor were released after this album ocean would start slowing down recording two more hit followed this album license to chill and i sleep better in someone else's bed which appeared new on the greatest hit album released in 1989 

one of billy ocean 's best release this album feature a nice mix of funky upbeat cut quot stand and deliver quot quot gun for hire quot and romantic quot quiet storm quot ballad quot the colour of love quot quot here 's to you quot the highlight of the album is the full length version of the huge hit quot get outta my dream get into my car quot the version on his greatest hit cd wa a shorter radio edit this album is filled with fun pop music but there are enough sophisticated touch to keep it interesting such a a trumpet solo on the uptempo song quot pleasure quot for fan of elegant 80 music this will be a nice addition to your collection 

i 've only really heard three of billy ocean 's album but this is probably not his best billy ocean wa one of my favorite singer back in the early '80 's so i may enjoy this album more than others his popular ballad the colour of love is one of the better hit but i think i like here 's to you better here 's to you ha better lyric more positive than the colour of love and the rhythm sounded just a little more like a tender ballad get outta my dream get into my car wa a song that wa popular on the radio back then but seems a little silly to listen to these day a a whole this album disappoints a bit but is n't too bad perhaps with a couple more hit on this album it would have been one worth keeping for the long run 

tear down these wall wa billy ocean 's final run at chart success the album feature one of the most reviled song from the 80 's get outta my dream get into my car it generally make the list for worst song from the 80 's but it is a little harsh a the song ha a fun innocent charm that seems to be missing from most song these day it made it way to number one and it wa the last time mr ocean had a top ten single he became a casualty of the grunge movement in the early 90 's a most 80 's star who were perceived to be soft met up with a similar chart demise 

this billy ocean album is still one of my favorite for him to follow the very successful love zone album with this platinum album is an understatement the big hit were get out of my dream the colour of love and tear down these wall but they 're no contest to my favorite here they are the grooving gun for hire and the rumbling pleasure some other song i like are soon a you 're ready calypso girl and because of you but gun is still strong today with that superb horn section the danceable rhythm and other aspect i played that song over and over on the tape in 1988 one of 1988 's best album to be released in at a time when 1987 song and album were number one hit in may june and the summer of '88 

jamaica native billy ocean had a top 20 hit in 1976 love really hurt without you that should have appeared on this compilation with a few original track the original track are license to chill and i sleep better in someone else's bed the latter track feature will smith originally known a the fresh prince who co wrote the track hit from 1984 's suddenly are the title track caribbean queen no more love on the run loverboy and mystery lady from 1986 's love zone are the title track and there will be sad song to make you cry from 1988 's tear down these wall are the title track the color of love here's to you and get out of my dream get into my car love is forever from love zone should be on this collection also there 's when the going get tough the tough get going from the 1985 film the jewel of the nile in the video the film 's star michael douglas kathleen turner and danny devito they starred in the 1984 predecessor romancing the stone appear a background vocalist for ocean performing the song on stage the actor were probably just lip synching some of these song were written by robert john mutt lange who produced music for the car and his country superstar wife shania twain 

this is one of the best randb singer with a soft touch i really did like his music he had so many good song i really did like billy i still hear his music on the radio now he sings so well that you understand every word that he say i would truly recommend anoyone who like rand b music to definitely buy this album because it contains a lot of good song from billy it contains love zone loverboy when the going get tough the tough get going caribbean queen suddenly sad song and many other good song so therefore this is a very nice album i really do enjoy this album 

billy ocean good old billy ocean yepp this is how real pop music is supposed to sound like it seems all his golden oldie have been included on this greatest hit album when the going get tough loverboy get out of my dream and carribean queen and yes license to chill is there too plus some ballad but i find them boring it 's a pity that this is a cd rather than a dvd since the videoclips of this singer are extremely entertaining i mean one of them feature danny de vito another show jabba the hutt or wa that danny in disguise billy ocean ha always been a visual experience not just your average pop singer but sure the music without the clip work just a well well what more can i say 

the mid 80 's wa billy ocean 's heyday in particular the period spanning the emergence of his first hit caribbean queen the single from his 1986 love zone album and the first single from tear down these wall get outta my dream this collection of hit by billy ocean nee leslie sebastian charles show how he specialized in heart melting ballad on one extreme and high energy synth pop anthem on the other suddenly his 1984 album is represented by four song one is the catchy u 1 caribbean queen no more love on the run part of which borrows the syncopated rhythm from michael jackson 's billie jean the sound effect includes eerie laughter similar to vincent price in thriller and some suggestive sound not surprising in this song about a caribbean seductress with painted on jean the highlight is v jeffrey smith 's brief sax solo the title track is a schmaltzy ballad on how suddenly one wake up and find oneself in love loverboy co written by producer keith diamond and mutt lange ha a wandering pulsing synth beat throughout and a kind of hard driving chorus while mystery lady is a mid paced dance number when the going get tough the tough get going from jewel of the nile topped the uk chart and nearly did so in the u and is a feel good dance anthem with funky synths the male backup have a masculine growl on the chorus while the female singer soften thing up some of the refrain this hit wa co written by and executive produced by mutt lange this wa also included in love zone whose title track is a leisurely mid paced ballad punctuated by lush synths and a funky bass however the best song from that album and my personal ocean song ever is the tear jerker 1 there 'll be sad song to make you cry the string quiet clive davis like synths and ocean 's falsetto all combine to make this a winner in saying how love song touch the very heart of someone ocean reprises what elton john sang two year earlier that sad song say so much ocean 's last big hit wa get outta my dream get into my car another catchy dance anthem and another soundtrack song from the corey feldman vehicle no pun intended licence to drive some eye rolling suggestive car talk involves touch my bumper and let me take your wheel but this wa big enough to reach 1 also from tear down these wall is the colour of love another attempt at a hit ballad which doe n't have the same effect a suddenly or there 'll be sad song of the two new song licence to chill fit more in the dance pop category and is a close cousin to get out of my dream mutt lange 's production touch are evident here particularly in the anthemic refrain yeah billy yo billy way to go billy ditto for the funky masculine bed hopping of i sleep so much better in someone else 's bed i ca n't hardly imagine someone like ocean singing something so sexist but that aspect of the song is given by the fresh prince portraying the smooth talking cad and mimi the put upon woman in a typical lover 's quarrel a this compilation is released by jive record his late 70 's hit such a love really hurt without you and red light spell danger released on gto record are n't included that is on the ultimate collection released last year still a tighter and more cohesive package showing ocean during his peak year 

if you grew up in the 80 's early 90 's you know who billy ocean is this cd take me back in time i can reminisce and dance to my favorite get out of my dream and get into my car 

the best thing about getting old classic is that they are inexpensive and still worth the listen i may be 23 but i'm very old school and when growing up all i 'd listen to is lionel richie stevie wonder marvin gaye etc but who i loved most of all wa listening to billy ocean take me back to my happier year and having fun there are a few track that i do n't remember but they are still good take me back to the miami vice theme wearing white pant era 

this artist wa never given the notariety he deserved in the eighty and the only time you hear his stuff these day is on quot retro night quot on the radio which is a shame billy ocean ha a smooth voice on ballad and then he can pump it up to get you moving on dance tune like loverboy and get outta my dream this cd compiles the best of his hit and you 'll enjoy reliving the musical past in that wonderful decade the eighty 

born in fyzbad trinidad in 1950 billy ocean grew up in england where he began his career in london dance club after a few lean year he began to make a name for himself a song writer and when he recorded the self authored carribbean queen in 1984 he suddenly emerged a one of the most popular tropical inflected performer of the decade ocean 's best known work of the 1980s is collected in this greatest hit anthology of twelve recording which open with when the going get tough a piece recorded for the film jewel of the nile and then wind it way through alternating dance floor favorite and lush love song to conclude with tear down these wall in both term of performance and songwriting skill each selection show the artist near the top of his form some twenty year after the peak of his popularity ocean 's best known pop hit are considerably le dated than one might expect largely because he did not rely exclusively on the heavily synthesized sound so typical of most 1980s performer the best of his work really is in such ballad a there 'll be sad song suddenly and love zone but several of his higher energy dancefloor cut also survive extremely well most notably the sharply cadenced loverboy it 's a nice package all of it easy on the ear all of it playing out with good sound quality if ocean 's music ha survived reasonably well ocean himself ha not ocean wa a very consistent performer and writer perhaps a shade too consistent for his own good for after several year there wa a general sense that his music wa repetitive in both style and content when combined with changing taste and a few brush with the law it wa enough to precipitate a sudden slide from the glory day of fame to an almost complete obscurity although he continues to write record and perform in europe he is now largely forgotten by the huge international audience he once commanded generally recommended but primarily to those recall him from his 1980s heyday gft amazon reviewer 

billy ocean wa one the most pleasant and emblematic figure of the pop movement between the early seventy his repertoire wa composed by easy to listen ballad and swinging piece that were influence by the rhythm soul he is visibly influenced by marvin gaye lou rawls and a little bit of barry white he wa owner of a natural sympathy and unique charisma that so many successful moment gave u along his career this compilation confirms why he wa the figure he wa do n't miss this important album part of the musical history 

so one day im over at enrique 's a haunt me billy used to be regular at way back when and billy come up to me and say quot i 've got this killer new song in my head but i'm not sure if it gonna sell quot so i ask him why not quot well you see it more of a nonlinear dramatic lydia lunch type of tune rather than my usual schtick quot well right then i asked him to lay it on me and knowing big billy i moved back a little because that cat spit like a mofo when he sings so afterwards i told him quot look man it a great tune but change the word quot get out of my subconscience and into my libido to get out of my dream and int my car quot well i think everyone know what happened from there i just have to say kiler song bo and i 'll keep the stool warm for you oh and i 'll also save you a seat 

trinidad born british singer billy ocean leslie sebastian charles rose to fame in the 80 's where he had hit after hit on both side of the atlantic with either happy pop song or tearjerking ballad billy ocean more then anyone is a perfect symbol of the 80 's with his music that is typical for that era and even if it 's a bit dated by now he still recorded some of the most memorable song of the 80 's however it all started in 1976 when he recorded his first album an eponymous album that spawned the hit single love really hurt without you that peaked at 2 in the uk and 22 in the u few people would know that 8 year later he would be at 1 in both country with his caribbean queen and also become one of the most successful caribbean singer of all time let 's take a look at the song it should 've started with love really hurt without you his first hit which is quite typical for the late 70 's a happy uptempo pop r b song with piano and disco vibe and ocean 's usual deep but happy voice i do n't know why it is n't on this version cause i have the same at home with it included next song is when the going get tough the tough get going which wa the soundtrack to michael douglas danny de vito 's film the jewel of the nile and on the video we had the two of them dancing to it it 's another happy uptempo and one of my all time favorite song that always make me smile it peaked at 1 in the uk and 2 in the u licence to chill is very simular to when the going actually with a happy beat and backround singer a closure with saxophone and it became his last hit in 1989 proving to be a typical 80 's artist caribbean queen from 1984 wa ocean 's biggest hit a song dedicated to all the beautiful woman from jamaica cuba bahamas haiti dominican repubic puerto rico and trinidad tobago the song is a midtempo that actually us the saxophone aswell the song wa also called european or african queen based on where it wa released but i prefered the caribbean there 'll be sad song to make you cry wa another massive hit peaking at 1 in the u this however wa one of his slowest most romantic song 80 's classic for sure loverboy is a pop rock song in fast pace from ocean 's succesfulsuddenlyalbum simply put another strong and memorable ocean trademark suddenly is a ballad and another big hit from 1984 but apart from most other of his song this one ai n't too remarkable or typical for him it 's just a decent ballad get outta my dream get into my car sound a little like when the going and it wa also soundtrack to a popular film the roger rabbitt film that is it became one of his biggest and last hit in 1988 love zone a power ballad with some good percussion and another memorable hook it became a top 10 in 1986 here 's to you wa never a single and is a quite forgettable ballad i think it wa first released for this complilation maybe they needed more song i sleep much better in someone else 's bed a trademark midtempo with some backround singer and happy vibe released in 1990 it failed to chart the colour of love another late ballad hit eventhough it 's very sweet song it did n't become a big a the single he released in the mid 80 's tear down these wall is a decent uptempo but sound alot like previous song aswell it wa released very late and never became a hit mystery lady the last single from the suddenly album is good aswell a midtempo that may not be a famous a the others but is a nice addition to this complilation overall although this compilation is old it is the best one with most of his hit included i'm bewildered though that love really hurt without you is n't included since it wa his first song and also the ballad love is forever that wa a minor hit eventhough it wa n't too hot other then that everything else is found here i would have liked to see the song in chronological order aswell here there is no order at all however the compilation is strong and if you 're curious to find out more about billy ocean here 's a perfect way to start rather then to buy his album a good purchase 

a a child and young adult when i tended to believe that all alternative music wa basically noisy unlistenable grunge likenirvanaoreverclearorthe president of the usa the pop song of my 1980s childhood occupied my attention because they were the most readily available alternative i used to adore the big hit on greatest hit and said they were my favourite song today however a an experienced music listener it is very clear to me that the material here is awfully dated and shallow the huge beat on when the going get tough which wa his only 1 hit and his second biggest hit get out of my dream were really catchy and even enchanting to me a a child but if i listen to them now in the library at melbourne university they seem awfully dated the same is true of the earlier carribbean queen whilst license to chill is even worse in this respect the slower material to which billy 's big voice wa never suited come off a even worse i always thought here 's to you and loverboy were terribly soppy and it 's easy to imagine how i would feel about them nowadays this is something i want to note a something i have given up and it is so dated with it big beat dance track and so soppy on the ballad that one should steer clear of it 

this cd wa amazing i loved it it wa so good to hear some of my favorite billy ocean song like suddenly caribbean queen love zone they'll be sad song among others this took me on a nice stroll down memory lane if you are a fan of billy ocean get this cd asap 

this disc is okay but it doe n't show the talent amp depth of this man from 76 82 he wa grooving then he came stateside and wa watered down this set hardly doe the man justice he is a very talented artist who deserves better 

from the middle 1970s through the next decade billy ocean wa a regular vistor to the chart on both side of the atlantic with his special brand of soulful pop the melodic appeal of song like get outta my dream caribbean queen and loverboy is still there and track like when the going get tough colour of love and there 'll be sad song sound even better these day when the chart are filled with bland pop and boring rap there 's just one unforgivable omission here the great song red light spell danger that wa a huge hit for ocean in the mid seventy no collection could be considered complete without that masterpiece 

mr leslie sebastian charles from trinidad in the southeast caribbean released an impressive amount of cool rock r amp b material in the '80 's which is unfortuneatly the limit of his musical ability this compilation wa put together in 1989 and mr ocean 's '93 effort quot time to move on quot even though i have n't seen of heard it anywhere feature him without his long time mustache which i thought had made him quite popular with the lady in the '80 's and dreadlock i even remember reading somewhere that billy wa at one time suspected of drug possession or dealing but of course one know that you ca n't believe everything that 's in print or what 's on the screen anyway on to the track included on this cd the number one hit quot when the going get 's tough the tough get going quot is first my other favorite are quot licence to chill quot quot caribbean queen no more love on the run quot quot loverboy quot a top ten hit in '85 my new favorite by him quot get out of my dream get into my car quot and finally the funky rap beat filled quot i sleep much better in someone else 's bed quot oohh very provocative indeed so i think this album is pretty good strictly from a person 's viewpoint which still ha a place in their music collection for solo group or compilation from the '80 's like i do it 's not too bad really 

this is a collection of billy ocean 's biggest hit from the peak of his career he had an impressive string of hit and cover a good deal of ground from fast rocker to slow ballad to mid tempo love song the song at the end of the collection start to lose steam and represent the end of billy ocean 's super stardom but for the first 3 4 of the collection it 's a wonderful blast from the past 

billy ocean if you call him the poor man 's michael jackson you should be smacked upside your head despite quot caribbean queen quot having a keyboard part that sound a little like quot billy jean quot billy manages to diversify to cutesy dance pop funky r amp b to smothering slow jam take the get up anthem quot when the going get tough quot and quot get out of my dream quot both fast paced grooving pop tune with peppy sing along tune like those it s nearly a crime that he wa n't crowned the king of the era then there are adult contemporary gem which are sang sweetly and lightly like quot suddenly quot and quot there ll be sad song quot billy 's funkiest track that hint of the island is quot love zone quot quot loverboy quot is a stomping rock beat dancer quot tear down these wall quot is a good combo of a pop song in a slower more romantic way quot mystery lady quot is a romantic tribute also billy give u guest like the fresh prince now known a will smith and robert lange who produced heavy metal monster ac dc and def leppard before this and country queen wife shania twain after then of course there is quot caribbean queen quot the blessing and the curse it 's kind of sad that the despite being known before the breakout hit quot caribbean queen quot a funky fusion of dance pop and r amp b suavness that none of those track are included on here billy ocean 's quot greatest hit quot start off with that unforgettable eighty jam career wise not by tracklisting and touch on all 3 of his jive album but nothing before or after that look at the date on this disc 1989 is that an omen unfortunately all of billy 's other stuff appear to be out of print or only available a costly import when you listen to this disc you will fell something whether it is joy or sorrow i almost second guessed the man and thought the only song i liked would the upbeat well known radio staple i didn t even remember the adult contemporary staple ballad this album is essential 1980s i guess some people have a time period in which they do their most successful work not a real revelation by any mean but billy ocean wa n't just a part of the music scene during his run billy owned it here s to you mr ocean 

i enjoyed this collection some song i think were missing but i wa a greatest hit cd that span his career i discovered an article online or newspaper that he 's alive and well writing song and recording track for a new album he look good for his age he ha long white dread lock now time ha moved forward but his voice and his drive is still intact 

by all mean necessary gave u a taste of what wa to come on this it 's like he lead u with baby step to this this album is a beast it start with a nice introduction by kwame ture aka stokely carmichael spoken in his characteristic soft and eloquent style and that lead right into the first track which start out wake up take the pillow from your head and put a book in it that in itself should prove that this would be a different kind of album this album pushed you to think at the same time kr wa experimenting greatly with various lyric flow at this time the result is an absolute masterpiece o from a hip hop standpoint i do n't think this one got much radio play but it wa n't created for that purpose if i could i 'd buy everybody a copy of this seriously we need to hear more music like this these day 

this came out in the midst of a lot of negativity in hip hop which ha since overtaken the genre kr one did a good job here in denouncing racism both inside and outside of the black community dealing with issue of identity the homeless and ya strugglin note the subtle swipe at michael jackson in the latter and an all star jam with the bdp crew d nice miss melody sister harmony etc some excerpt from stokely carmichael yes that stoke shortly before his death are quite enlightening sadly kris parker 's hold on the youth did not last much longer a gangster c rap went on to destroy the music but that 's another story get this and see how rap could have been 

bdp wa history for me amp many others black history at it 's finest the great mind of kr one spoke of thing that a school book could n't or would n't mention the music is a strong a the message along with rakim public enemy gil scott heron etc school is in session before rap got watered down this wa the real deal the way the word were meant to be said track 9 amp 13 do n't front 

with this 1990 release boogie down production wa steamrolling their way to legendary status this wa back when bdp dropped fresh material every year from '87 criminal minded until '92 sex violence so that 's not necessarily a easy a it may sound with classic track like love 's gonna get 'cha ya strugglin' house ni s 100 gun ja rule bit this joint beef and blackman in effect you know that the album is at the very least doper than most other 1990 hip hop release but there are solid track laced throughout the album and there are no filler personally i ca n't imagine why anyone would give this album le than 5 star but that 's just me this album is just a fresh now a it wa 17 oh my god 17 year year ago a far a flaw i ca n't think of any sure kr get political so obviously it 's going to rub some people the wrong way like most political stance do but i loved it and saw nothing wrong with it the beat are strictly b boy styled boom bap vibe and nothing le if you ai n't feelin' that then you may be browsing the wrong genre for your music edutainment is just that educational entertainment there is n't a beat that kr one ca n't get busy on and he entertains the mass with knowledge instead of dream of material prosperity hip hop head all around the world myself included recognize him a one of the illest to ever stand in front of a microphone the production is on point so what more could you ask for i recommend grabbing this album if you cross path with it standout track the homeless ya strugglin' feat kwame toure beef my favorite ya know the rule love 's gonna get 'cha material love house ni s blackman in effect original lyric feat special k and 100 gun 

standout cut quot love 's gonna getcha quot recently covered by none other than snoop doggy dogg beef kris checked the beef industry long before oprah ya struggling disdainful r amp b artist are skewered in this playful assault breath control ii a mellow reggae message moment get this album folk it 's still hot 

should have been called disappointment bdp is no pe krs1 's `knowledge' is really no more than nation of islam rhetoric not so cleverly put to music krs1 wa always more `preacher' than `teacher' inviting obedience rather than introspection here in `ya strugglin' he add homophobia to his cannon of hate 

with stripped down production brilliant lyric and the fiercest delivery of his career kr one and company deliver the best lp in thier entire musical cannon while many disliked and or misunderstood this album when it first appeared the last decade and a half have opened mind and ear to it 's sheer daring and revolutionary impact the music a always is sliced down to the barest essential a simple 808 drum machine here some reggae flavoring there the hypnotic breath control ii african drum the homeless and even wah wah guitar over funky drum original lyric my personal fave and the production is n't too crowded allowing parker 's biting incisive lyric and terrific vocal plenty of breathing room and the attention they deserve while thing do get a bit preachy the sheer enjoyment of these performance will leaven out the heavy handed tone of the word a rap lp wa never more aptly titled school is in session 

reader of this space may be aware that over the past year or so i have gone to great length to highlight some of the blue great that i wa doggedly devoted to a a kid and still am and helped form in me and others from my generation the generation of '68 a well an important musical component a we fought our political battle for a more just society the name of lead belly josh white son house muddy water and the like easily come to mind and then in a whisper in the back of the brain come do n't forget buddy guy well of course the chicago blue branch of the blue tree would not be complete without recognizing what every serious blue artist of the time recognized here wa a master this cd only go to prove the point electric guitar acoustic guitar solo with junior well without junior a a backup to others guy did it all even with all star help of jeff beck and the like here this is strictly buddy 's gig that 's why there wa that little whisper so what is good here well how about the title track damn right i 've got the blue black night and the jump tune where is the next one coming from but for my money buddy 's rendition of mustang sally is worth the price of admission ca n't you just see sally riding now listen and see if you agree 

fan of blue music know that there are some living legend which we are all lucky to listen to and if we are really lucky we get to see them live at their best buddy guy rank high among the living legend of the blue he ha influenced and been appreciated by some of the truly great musician of both rock and blue jimi hendrix stevie ray vaughan jeff beck and eric clapton were and are among his greatest fan they like so many others appreciate his virtuosity and his skill at improvisation in interview regarding damn right i 've got the blue guy say that silvertone allowed him to do on record what he had been longing to do for year damn right nicely show case guy 's skill and genius at the guitar he doe cover of song by willie dixon eddie boyd louis jordan and john hiatt a well a a number of original including the original with help from jeff beck buddy sizzle on mustang sally black night is done in the heartfelt and soulful manner that only buddy can do the instrumental remembering stevie is a wonderful tribute to stevie ray vaughan this is a wonderful cd it wa done in a way that buddy guy had long wanted to do moreover it brings the blue to a greater audience and there is truly nothing wrong with that if we are to keep the blue alive we need cd 's such a this go for it buddy 

damn right this is a great cd buddy prof that he can rock a well a play great blue i love the song mustang sally and his almost 7 minute tribute to stevie ray vaughn rememberin stevie is just great i think that this cd ha something for blue and rock fan alike and would highly recomend it 

excellent production and mixing crisp clear sound and a strong track list make this one of buddy guy 's strongest record his second best best latter day album right behind 1994 's pure blue cd slippin' in the track list span classic electric blue memphis soul and well john hiatt guy 's cover of hiatt 's where is the next one coming from is pretty good but doe n't really add anything new to the song and we do n't really need another version of early in the morning especially not this rather bland one but there are highlight a plenty nevertheless guy 's eight minute rendition of eddie boyd 's classic five long year is a delicious smouldering slow blue and he lay down a great mustang sally and a fine rendition of big jay mcneely 's mournful there is something on your mind buddy guy 's expressive tenor voice suit the slow tortured blue song on this set very well but he performs equally well on the powerful swaggering title track and the mid tempo too broke to spend the night two of his best self penned song for a long long time too broke in particular is strongly reminiscent of guy 's sizzling 60 recording for chess and this spirited reading of willie dixon 's let me love you baby is among the highlight a well there is an expanded edition out there which add two bonus track and while none of those are absolutely essential they 're not bottom of the barrel scraping either so if you do n't already have the original album by all mean get the one with the bonus cut on it no need to buy it again if you do though damn right is a really fine album deservingly winning guy an emmy in 1991 the sometimes erratic veteran play some tremendous electric guitar and the self penned material show that buddy guy 's muse is not spent after all 

one of my friend suggest this cd to me if you like blue you 'll like it well he wa damn right this cd is just perfect all song are really great and if you like blue this one is for you 

this is the one that put buddy back on the blue map with the help of several well known friend including mark knopfler jeff beck eric clapton who once called him the greatest live blue guitarist and the great memphis horn buddy burn on the more uptempo tune like the soulful groove of quot where is the next one coming from quot amp a definitive version of the classic quot mustang sally quot buddy 's gritty passionate vocal are intense without being totally over the top amp the background vocal are perfect the slower tune are not the old tired by the book standard slow blue but are leisurely rolling blue focused a much on piano amp horn a on buddy 's guitar he close thing out with quot rememberin' stevie quot paying tribute to his own biggest fan 

when buddy guy played the hard rock caf eacute in bangkok in 1992 he wa asked which present day `blues' guitarist he liked buddy just laughed and said that he wa the only real blue guitarist left a everybody else wa just in it for the money he told the story of when he had followed muddy water up to chicago from mississippi in the 50 's muddy water wa broke and buddy wanted to be just like him in fact on his first meeting with his idol he claimed that muddy had saved his life a if he had n't shared his dried salami amp cheese with him the young buddy guy would have starved to death for these of you wanting to hear some genuine `blues' music recorded in a modern studio with all the sound quality that this give this is the album for you it wa unanimously voted blue album of the year by the grammies in 1992 this album just reek of class buddy used his basic road band of long time bassist greg rzab on bass mick weaver on keyboard and richie hayward on drum temporarily borrowed from little feat the group went to battery studio with producer john porter who doe a superb job keeping the sound clear and precise several musician stopped round during this period to pay their respect and add a lick here and a solo there these people included the guitarist jeff beck eric clapton and mark knopfler plus the memphis horn strangely one of the weaker moment on the album is early in the morning which ha the memphis horn clapton amp beck on it it leaf the feeling that perhaps it wa left on the album just to add to the star rating not for it 's actual quality the other low point on the album is a run through of sir mack rice 's mustang sally a fine song but buddy doe little to distinguish his version from the 500 other cover version the rest of the album though is pure golden blue the two long slow blue workout are outstanding and allow buddy to do what he doe best play his guitar you get eight and a half minute of the eddie boyd classic five long year and seven amp a half minute of black night by jesse robinson john porter 's production leaf both of these song stripped to the bone and let the emotion drip from the guitar amp vocal spiritually these song leave you exhausted but nothing can prepare you for the album final cut which is buddy guy 's tribute to his friend stevie ray vaughn remembering stevie is an outstanding instrumental blue song that literally sends shiver up and down your spine close your eye and you can see buddy playing with his eye shut and the band giving sympathetic support with stevie looking down from high above on this album buddy guy make mere pale imitator of all those that try to follow him if you want the blue go for the real thing go for buddy mott the dog 

i recently read a review on the 2005 34 expanded edition 34 of this great classic blue album and could not believe that they would edit out the great guitar work jeff beck did on 34 mustang sally 34 so i bought it and compared the two and sure enough it 's gone along with some other le significant guest work on other cut so if you want to hear how this album wa intended to be heard the one that won blue album of the year get the original 1991 version fantastic 

buddy guy is one of the top blue guitar man the others are jimi hendrix gary moore srv in my opinion this cd is his best work you must put this at cdplayer and hear a loud a you can so you 'll be in tune with one of the most energetic consistent emotional blue set ever recorded buddy 's vocal tune are sensually incendiary with the combination of right music choice resulting this great album with explosive interpretation of mustang sally and passionate in all other track i really recomend this 'dam'n right ' one of my best favorite in my collection 

there are two giant that keep on promoting the lifestyle of the blue the first is b b king the other buddy guy here is a man that know the meaning of the blue at time he wa too poor to afford guitar string and used wire instead how he ha any pad left on his fingertip to play i 'll never know but he doe play here and it is very good there is no doubt that this is an excellent album with the first note of the title track guy make his guitar cry throughout his solo and his voice is full of soul and pain it doe n't slow down after that he then turn around and doe the john hiatt cover of where is the next one coming from with mark knopfler and the memphis horn backing him up again an a effort from the blue master jeff beck appears on mustang sally and then team up with eric clapton to provide additional lick on louis jordan 's early in the morning this whole album is nothing but high powered blue the album culminates with the powerful rememberin' stevie a tribute to the late great guitar master and guy 's dear friend the tune is hauntingly beautiful and guy bear his soul for all to hear this album is what the blue are about solid guitar playing strong vocal and feeling if you 're a big blue guitar fan this is a must have for your collection you ca n't go wrong with it 

my first buddy guy album i think it is pretty good i like the title track i find the blue classic quot 5 long year quot interesting quite different from the bb king and eric clapton version i usually do n't like the fender tone it is can be a little too thin or piercing for my taste but buddy ha a tone that is warm by fender standard i read somewhere that he us a fender stratocaster and fender bassman amplifier perhaps he play with his finger rather than a pick well whatever it wa sound quot right quot buddy is a blue icon 

this last about 54 minute 4 track feature horn there are three original guy track all are great one title track 2 a slow moody instrumental dedicated to stevie ray vaughan 3 one of guy 's best song and capture some ferocious guitar playing for 5 minute and is called too broke too spend the night if you wanted to you could fit all of these song into contemporary blue music for either lyric or music but only six of the ten track fit in a traditional sense there 's 3 slow blue including the instrumental track called rememberin' stevie the classic black night done by willie nelson and dr john later and also five long year another classic covered in eric clapton 's all blue album from the cradle i do n't want insult the great musician on this album but you could say the only truly remarkable thing about it is buddy himself at his top level of playing on this record he is definetely one of the best guitar player in blue ups alot of powerful vocal the keyboard are used perfectly not over or underdone let me love you baby is a song that wa written by willie dixon and one of the last song steve vaughan covered on record and one of buddy 's best recording there may be possible down here for you though it is all great music in my opinion the extra guitar player were almost completely unhelpful and were uneeded at any rate of course mark knopfler and eric clapton did n't take anything away but your ear would have to put mine to shame to be able to distinguish them jeff beck wa clear but he did n't do anything guy could n't do bottom line is that these great guitarist were just for promotion and they probably knew it a for john porter and neil hubbard who are probably in guy 's live band or studio musician one or both played on all track including the one with the other guitarist they were probably only there for the occasional rythm or tiny sound effect or mimicry and really were n't much help even if they did more they maybe even taking away from buddy at time i ca n't even understand guy using them there were back up vocalist in 3 song which is an uncommon thing in straight blue lastly highly produced and slightly cluttered with people who may not have belonged the production may bother some blue fan but did however cause some great sound through the record and did n't take away from the character which guy and the blue is known for if you are looking for guy at a more raw hard blue stage then get stone crazy which is a standard buddy on lead guitar and his brother phil doing back up work then bass and drum it 's simple and also one of the classic harcore blue album 

if you have n't learned already you 'll learn now that too short is one of my favorite rapper almost everything he dropped up until 1995 ha either been classic or near classic material here is his number seven album shorty the pimp more of the oakland sounding funk that he is known to put out with the help of his right hand producer ant bank who produced the majority of this album so you know it 's going to be good some track that immediately stood out to me were hoe and no love from oakland two perfect sounding song the latter song short dog spit two extremely long verse over a weird bank beat step daddy is a funny song about short playing the role hooking up with a woman with kid to me that is the best song on the album hoochie is another great song produced by d'wayne wiggins the lead single from this album were in the trunk where short spit one long verse and i want to be free that 's the truth where he rhyme about how bad cop in oakland are for all you newcommers to short you 'll be suprised that he actually rhymed about something else more than sex near the end ant bank pooh man and mhisani goldy come in for something to ride to where after they rhyme the beat just play for an additional six or seven minute shorty the pimp is an excellent album especially if you 're a fan of too short some of the track sound dated but never loose their replay value fan of bay area rap will like this one this is a perfect album to get hyped up for whats one of my personal favorite albumsget in where you fit in peace lyric aproduction a guest appearance amusical vibe atop 5 track 1 step daddy2 no love from oakland3 something to ride to featuring pooh man ant bank and goldy 4 hoes5 i want to be free and thats the truth 

this is by far too short 's best album the whole thing is full of his unique laid back flow and yay area beat in the trunk and i ain't nothin' but a dog are the best song epitomizing short 's lifestyle in the trunk ha the funkiest beat and the bass you get submerged in it the production on the whole album is tight and short dog lay it all out for the world to see the oaktown lifestyle he 's an oakland vet and want everybody to know it this is a no compromise album and one of the best in my collection 

too short outdid himself on shorty the pimp which is arguably his best effort behind get in where you fit in it what you would expect from short boasting of having woman and making having a lot of money but he doe take a serious approach on here with i want to be free and so you want to be a gangster the best track imo is the surprising no love from oakland throughout shorty the pimp is infused with plenty of p funk sample but then again what can you expect from classic too short 

this is the oldest hort album i have and probably one of his top album i 'd give one 5 star four 4 5 star two 3 5 star and two 4 star only 10 song on here but straight funk on the beat a every beat on every song and interlude on here is tight ant bank produce 5 of the song hort dog doe 4 and d'wayne wiggins doe 1 of the 10 song 1 is a classic 1 is almost a classic 1 is ok and the rest are good no bad one guest are on only 1 song so you get a great deal of the oaktown pimp on here a usual do n't listen to this if you are n't a fan of some dirty vulgar lyric that made u all love hort to begin with a must have for fan of true funk 2 8 5 3 9 dirty song 4 8 5 another dirty one 5 9 about oakland 6 8 about crooked cop 7 8 5 about hoochies groupie 8 10 classic dirty song with great upbeat production 9 8 10 9 5 about being a gangster 11 7 f ant bank pooh man goldy todd shaw b 4 29 66 b los angeles ca moved to oakland cacheck all my review 

i'm giving this album 5 star to show that i have more regard and compassion for too short than he seems to have for my gender 

i have been listening to rap for a long time and no one can compete with too hort his oaktown style is like no other when i listen to this record i am brought back to a certain time period inn a place the only too hort can emulate too hort brings classic rap of pimpin slangin dope and riding old school ride down the street it is the representation of an era that canont be reprodiced the early 90 's no love from oakland stand out showing the real oaktown funky ant bank beat something to ride to feature the dangerous crew and is one of my favorite track with 11 minute of staight oakland ant bank funkn beat it just let me smoke and ride on the city steets all day cop it if u a player 

boogie down production take aim at the medium and the mind state that hinders black american on the controversial lp sex and violence kr one practice edutainment a he make attempt at both educating and entertaining with the same breath this album start off with the original way featuring freddie foxxx a a performance opener with a simple break beat and a bass kr take aim at sucker emcee with duck down with a more up tempo track ruff ruff featuring freddie foxxx is 70 feel track with the guitar lick loop the story tale of 13 and good with an underlying funk track help this to be one of the album 's standout teaching the truth about all aspect of life including religion poisonous product ha an alternative to what ha been taught say gal is a reggae melody a kr attack the quote rape victim of star and celebrity with question like why you go to the hotel he also take a swing at the median such a radio and television on the title track a he flow a hip hop reggae style it is difficult to mix both education and entertainment but boogie down productions' attempt wa a good one worth lending an ear to 

it just never cease to amaze me how kr one stayed on top of his game in the late 80 's and early 90 's with bdp 's final album sex and violence kris wa going through a lot of problem with his personal life which included a divorce from his wife m melody many know her from the self destruction single and apparently wa reducing the people in his bdp circle according to the linear note not to mention what he did at the p m dawn concert so there wa some stuff going on while recording this album when i first heard this album i wa damn near blown away everything here is on point every song here is amazing in it own way a it ha it 's own message drug dealer is a song about doing something positive instead of selling drug on question and answer kris go at those fradulant magazine and doe his own self interview do n't dis the source though their chief editor give him 4 1 2 mics for this lp even 13 and good is a interesting story about hooking up with an underage girl with an unusual ending to the plot when he is not kicking message kris' mic skill are still on point on the amazing like a throttle he go with a vingence over a dope beat the next build and destroy he get a lot off his mind going towards if rapper who are true to the islam nation are legitimate in their rhyme the final track the real holy place kris question christianity and the credibility of the holy bible even freddie foxxx show off on the origonal way and drop a long facinating verse on ruff ruff with producer like himself kenny parker prince paul d square and paul joey along with willie d and sidney mill help create this great album it 's very unfortunate that this wa bdp 's least selling album i guess everyone 's ear wa heading out to the west coast because they were dropping classic album aroung this time sex and violence should be enjoyed by all fan of east coast or early 90 's rap in the word of kris himself this album is fresh for 1992 you suckas peace lyric a production aguest appearance a musical vibe atop 5 track 1 like a throttle2 13 and good3 drug dealer4 sex and violence5 ruff ruff featuring freddie foxxx honorable mention 1 build and destroy2 sex and violence3 we in here 

this album ha always been under appreciated but he go quite hardcore on this album he also ha some beat by prince paul some pretty dope beat and of course his knowledge still reign supreme on this album freddie foxxx is even on this album i would recommend this album battle rhyme and some fun rap and some hard rap on here lyric 10 10 production 9 10 x factor 9 10 classic 8 10 replay 9total 8 5 out of 10 finger 

this is probably my favorite bdp album it ha great lyric great beat and is really a personal album kr one talk about issue dealing with sex drug and violence i ca n't believe that this got bad review when it first came out favorite include duck down like a throttle build and destroy poisonous product question and answer and sex and violence get this and all of bdp 's album to support the real hip hop 

kr 1 ha always been light year ahead of the rap game and the sex and violence cd is just one more item of proof for that statement rapper like emenem and rakim have recieved an abundance of well deserved credit for their lyrical witticism kr 1 however take lyrical wit to another level by using his tounge twisting talent to speak on more complicating issue such a the ethnic history of drug dealer the hipocrisy of 5 noi rapper the irs a the true pimp of the world and more the tragedy of this cd and kr ha nothing to do with kr 's tendency to preach but rather with the immaturity and low level gratuity of a rap industry that ha gone mainstream in fact this is exactly what this cd is all about it may very well be that kr will sadly go under recognized by an industry that he helped revolutionized but i believe that will only be temporary if hip hop ever grows up and evolves beyond thug drug and adolescent narcisstic content then it may very well reflect on artist like kr 1 and give him the prop he deserved since his introduction to the rap game 

sex violence released in the winter of 1992 this fifth studio album from boogie down production found it frontman kr one in a state of transition in his personal life he wa recently divorced from wife and fellow rapper m melodie and had been recently sued by a former manager the `bdp crew' wa whittled down to dj kenny parker and sideman will `willy d' broady in the liner note a bitter kr take the time to point out that others are not down so stop frontin' west coast based rap act were coming into their own a a collective from ice cube to cypress hill the geto boy gave a southern face to gangster rap and east coast based rap had a handful of new face like black sheep and naughty by nature what 's more a trend of infighting began with some of bdp 's fellow politically minded peer like x clan and poor righteous teacher who took to criticizing kr on record or interview kr one 's response to all of this wa not a the pacifist he had gained a rep for being but to come out with gun blazing criminal minded style the stark cover art by robert williams let listener know this will not be the average hip hop statement this wa perhaps kr one 's angriest album since his first taking swipe at various perceived enemy both internal and external to hip hop culture throughout the lp there are superb production value by the artist dj kenny parker kr one and guest collaborator prince paul who are the pimp title track and pal joey duck down question and answer take on hip hop journalism with a skeptical eye build and destroy question whether islam influenced rapper are just bandwagon hopping say gal bash backstage groupie behavior drug dealer admonishes street level drug merchant to at least try to go legit appealing to civic mindedness in drug lord may seem uncouth but in krs' worldview organize and legitimize your business remember everybody else did this the album 's other subversive track is 13 good a tale of a disco club hookup gone terribly wrong guy meet girl at nightclub they go home to be intimate girl admits to being 13 get mad call her cop father who 's apparently on the `down low' this predates r kelly 's trapped in the closet song by over 10 year by the way the album hearkens back to by all mean necessary with a spoken word closer the real holy place where kr wax philosophic about contemporary religious trend the anger reflected on this album spilled over into real life a kr crew would bum rush alternative rap act pm dawn at a performance and physically remove them from the stage album sale were overshadowed by rap 's newer superstar and likely the soundscan system which wa n't kind to anyone who did n't post big number in their first week a a result this is arguably the most slept on release from bdp a deluxe re release should include the excellent remix to we in there and any other bonus material 

i really feel like this wa the best bdp album kr 1 is always amazing yes but this is just mind blowing it deserves 10 star start your hip hop collection with this 

so far my fave track 1 duck down sick wicked drum beat 2 like a throttle club banger how could you not dance to this one 3 we in there good loop 4 build and destroy this song give a black eye to the poor righteous teacher and x clan too many teacher in the class spoil the school after awhile you got blabberin' f in fool what are you doing for yourself black man tryin' hard to be the original man who the first man with the first tan on the first land with the first clan who give a d sucker wack or booty m c 's need not apply kr one made that abundantly clear on this album i do n't battle to win or lose i battle to ruin your whole career old school hip hop with a message a well what more can my ear ask for d 

i 've attempted to write this review before but it would not post due to it 's length so i 'll attempt to be brief notice i said attempt why would i run out of space writting about a seldom heralded little known bdp album well first being that i consider this album to be perfect and i mean perfect in every sense of the word sex and violence is my all time favorite album and i ai n't scared to admit it but first let 's set the historical context the blastmaster wa at a very strange time in his life when he made this album he had just divorced his wife m melodee he had split up from the majority of the bdp crew hence the harsh liner note for anyone but kenny parker and ill will to stop frontin' he 'd been subliminally dissed by x clan rip professor x wise intelligent from poor righteous teacher and prince be of p m dawn maybe even a little subliminally by ice cube and nwa although that one 's gotta be read into really deeply hell even d nice wa talking bad about kris in the source the heal project had failed bdp 's live album and corresponding video did not move the unit that he or his label had desired even worse east coast hip hop seemed to be on a decline this album wa released prior to illmatic what to do well for starter kr showed up impromptu at a p m dawn concert and unceremoniously through prince be off the stage damn kris is kinda big and then proceeded to rock the house to the tune of i'm still number one proof positive kr wa not havin it in '92 unfortunately all of these incident led to a very confused fan base seems everyone had gotten used to krs' stop the violence and edutainment message and forgotten criminal minded and by all mean necessary they also forgot that kr is still a human being and not some sort of deity ultimately his fan base left him a it ha done and will probably continue to do for year to come the fact that kr is an artist and will express himself with how he is feeling at the time need to be recognized i'm sure all hip hop fan have felt alienated by kr album or idea at some point myself included sex and violence is the culmination of all of kr frustration the blastmaster of old reared his ugly head and spit hard and fast kr bludgeon the competition with track like well everything except the real holy place which is a sort of spoken word piece about god being within u all and drug dealer on the later kr brilliantly advises drug dealer of the world to unite and use their money to improve the community of course all anyone heard wa that the dealer should organize their business and open up a school this wa again interpreted by any of his fickle fan base left that kr wanted to make drug dealer high school c'mon now open your mind and put a book in it other than those two song from the intro where kr play the role of a dj dying from lack of vinyl a big issue back in 92 believe me to the final grand indictment of the irs on who are the pimp kr seems to have no end of material for fueling his fire for the sudden prevalence and dominance of gangsta rap and most specifically nwa 's efil4zaggin album the fire of the single duck down and we in there came out punching with line like i spit on your 1 hit and in jail in a pair of panty you 'll look just stunning for x clan and prt there 's build and destroy where kr scientifically break both crew and his philosphy down with classic line like too many teacher in the class spoil the school after awhile you 've got blabbering f ckin fool ouch for society at large there 's the second single 13 and good say gal and poisonous product here kr edutains the mass about our musical and societal problem with infidelity morality vanity basically holding up a mirror for u to look at and ask what the f ck is wrong with you to explain all this madness kr supply question and answer here kr break down the point of the whole album in a format similar to imma break it down by eazy e kr interview himself about various time in his career his overall message his own sincerity and what he 's doing to help sadly this track wa never a single so no one ever heard kr explanation and most of the single fell on what were becoming deaf ear next come the biggest surprise of all the first is the crazy allout breath control fest of like a throttle this is the absolute best exercise in breath distribution ever i 've memorized every line in this album and am amazed to this day how kr rip this sh t the second big surprise come in the form of a newly invigorated freddie foxxx while foxxx had appeared earlier on kool g rap 's wanted dead or alive track money in the bank it is on track the original way and ruff ruff where freddie start repping the sound that made him the commodity he became a short while later his looooooooooong verse on ruff ruff is one of his best ever and if you ever meet me or kr or freddie and are so inclined to hear ha a great story behind it finally the result after all that the album did n't sell in fact it remains the worst selling bdp album of their carreer the first album to receive a mic in the source they were record before this album wa reviewed received a 4 1 2 rating the label released 3 single all of which have near classic must have extra track they did three video everything wa in place except for the alienated fan base maybe they 'd all jumped on the west coast band wagon of gangsterism and mysogyny more likely they just were n't ready for the new boom bap i figure when the revolution that na wu tang boot camp clik and ditc wa brought to the table kr had to feel like he wa slapped the teacha and more importantly innovator wa ahead of his time again pick it up so you can make it your time now guess that wa n't very brief huh 

it kind of hard to deny what kr one ha brought to the game his flow is phenomenal and the insight he give is precious even now standout track duck down ruff ruff dope match up with freddie foxx 13 and good the story of a guy who sleep with a teen that call her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitch poisonous product question and answer like a throttle we in here the real holy place the deepest track on here who are the pimp and the reggae tinged joint like say gal and sex and violence are gem also filler none bottom line bdp 's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day besides the slammin production kr showed that he wa 100 step ahead from the average rapper with this album any born again hip hop head would do well to start off with edutainment and work their way down to this album 

sex and violence although commerically his worst selling album of all the bdp album lyrically and production wise is his best a he ridded the rap world of x clan poor righteous teacher and the soft a mallow pie pm dawn on the single we in there and build and destroy the 12 single remix of the we in there single includes a track on the other side called feel the vibe feel the beat where he basically massacre that track and ended pm dawn 's and his former homey d nice 's career this had to be the first kr one lp that i could actually listen to the track more than i could just the lyric kr one wa going through a lot personally before this album the divorce from his wife m melodie the beef with former homie d nice and the fact that east coast rap at that time in 1992 had taken a back seat to west coast rap being dominated by nwa icecube ice t too short snoop d o c geto boy compton 's most wanted dj quik west coast rap had become the rage and the afro centric edutainment rap that the kr 's the rakims the public enemy 's the queen latifah 's jungle brother and tribe of the east had continue to build on top of the foundation already laid down had started to crumble east coast rap wa being largely ignored by yo mtv rap the video jukebox at the time the two largest video player of rap video unfortunately this album like a poster said earlier came two year before illmatic started the resurgence of east coast rap again but lyrically wa one of the better album hand down that wa released that year though this album will never get the mainstream prop that criminial minded by all mean necessary edutainment return of the boom bap and his self titled kr one album receieved but real hip hop head know that no mc would have dared come at kr on any level after this if this album wa released today everyone would think it wa so new and fresh and diverse a shame since this album came out in 1992 what doe that say about our current hip hop now 

this album is the straight up hardcore from beginning to end people slept on this album when it came out but they need to wake up and pick this up on the serious tip the most fiery cut duck down drug dealer sex amp violence build amp destroy most subversive track quot 13 amp good quot a tale of statuatory rape with a twist ending superb production value by kr 1 prince paul pal joey and others this is the last album by kr 1 recorded under the group moniker boogie down production check for his subsequent solo release return of the boom bap kr one self titled and i got next fresh for 1992 and ya know it 

the commercial failure of krs1s didactic venom is a tribute to the good taste of american rap fan he ha done better 

these boy been doing they thing for what 15 year now i didnt know about this album until recently i wa very familiar with ridin dirty tho i thought that that wa there first album hearing this album that came out 3 year earlier impressed me even more they laid down the groundwork for southern hip hop that wa based on blue soul and g funk this wa back in the early 90 's when southern hip hop and west coast were basically talking to each other both being heavily influenced off each other these guy along with 8 ball mjg triple six outkast goodie mobb and the geto boy are the only group that can be called dirty south legend 

back in 1992 before we had the internet where an up and coming artist who had a demo mixtape had the ability to upload and hopefully the right ear would hear it people would sell out of the trunk of their car and send it to local radio station etc manually well that is what the underground king did with their ep the southern way on big tyme record someone up at jive record got a hold of the tape told them to re record the song and add a few more new track to it and you have too hard to swallow this is what most people are familiar with when they hear this album there are many similarity in the song if you heard the southern way too hard to swallow the first song something good start off the album well many people do n't know that the song on too hard to swallow is edited while the explicit version is on the southern way the song here vibe well which i like next is the late pimp c solo track use me up where he sample bill withers cleverly also this song is edited a the explicit version appears on the southern way next is pocket full of stone which is different than the one that is on themenace ii society the original motion picture soundtrack a this version us an awkward sample from an ll cool j song i like the version on the soundtrack better short texas featuring blue light also appeared on the southern way but it no different than on this album the track ha a nice vintage 90 's feel to it cocaine in the back of the ride also appeared on the southern way the version here is a little modified production wise and sound way better than the earlier version i hate to say this but bun b wa off beat on the southern way version but sound perfect here too hard to swallow is a newly recorded track for this album and sound nice and ha a laid back vibe to it cramping my style feature a female rapper named infinity and the beat sample the isley brother between the sheet the track is okay but nothing too special while infinity and bun b go back and forth about relationship the next two song i feel like and i'm so bad are both pimp c solo to be honest they are okay but they showed him a a growing artist the next two song trill a n and 976 bun b are bun b solo that appeared on the southern way here they are modified and have better production while bun kick nice verse on both song the last song something good is a remix of the first song of the album the only difference are the beat is changed again and bun b change his last verse overall too hard to swallow is a pretty nice major label debut for the great ugk you can tell that both bun and pimp were growing artist who were taking chance with the music they were making and a you can see it all worked out this is an album i recommend to all if you do not have it i highly recommend you look for the southern way ep on the internet and you can see the comparison between the song on that and this album maybe jive rca sony record can reissue a legacy edition of this album and include the southern way ep track a well a the outtake from banned track that jive record told them to remove when making this album into one album just short of a classic in my book but one of the best for the early 90 's lyric a production b guest appearance bmusical vibe b top 5 song 1 something good extended mix 2 cocaine in the back of the ride3 too hard to swallow4 short texas featuring blue light 5 use me up 

ugk 65533 s first album is an undisputed dirty south classic this duo hailing from texas wa one of the first dirty south group that were not bass music to put it down along with geto boy eightball mjg ugk 65533 s debut album is beyond great the sample used in the song are not disgraceful and ugk are notorious for sampling on their earlier album the rapping compared to their skill now is a little lacking but they were in their developmental stage during this album still they drop memorable line and classic verse all throughout this album the best song include but are not limited to 65533 something good 65533 65533 use me up 65533 and 65533 cramping my style 65533 this album is a must have for all fan of ugk and of dirty south music 5 star classic 

definitely the best rap group in the south yes i think they 're better then the geto boyz eightball and mjg only 11 song but most of the song are long it 's from 1992 and i still rock it in 2005 guest are on a few song and each member ha a solo or 2 most of the lyric are either dirty or about cocaine it ha 2 classic 2 i skip and 2 are ok production is good on most song and handled by bernie bismarck pimp c bun b on all the track a must have southern rap album that paved the way for many to come from texas 1 8 2 9 pimp c f d j bird about being played good beat 3 8 5 the song that made a name for them about cocaine also on menace ii society 4 8 f blue light about cocaine 5 6 another one about yae yo 6 5 5 slow beat 7 7 5 great beat bun b f ininity it be better w o her verse 8 8 pimp c solo 9 7 5 dirty song by pimp c 10 10 classic w great beat bun b solo 11 10 classic dirty song w great beat by bun b 12 remix of 1 beat is a little worse on this one bun b bernard freeman b 1973 port arthur txpimp c chad butler b 12 73 d 12 4 07 port arthur txunderground kingz check all my review 

way before ludacris david banner lil flip no limit record cash money all that other so called southern rap wa the underground kingz and to this day they 're still the kingz of the underground and the south way ahead of their time and can never be outdone this record along with super tight ridin' dirty are must have you 've been missin' out if ya ai n't heard smoke fat listen loud peace 

this is da cd that put me on 2 ugk way back n da dayz i mean way back when da song quot tell me something good quot wa laced with da isley brother quot summer breeze quot sample loop not available on this cd it wa a local tape release only this cd contains what i believe 2 b the greatest dopeman song ever created 2 this day quot pocket full of stone quot i know u probably heard it on da quot menace 2 society quot soundtrack but this cd contains the pure and uncut version and da song quot cocaine n da back of the ride quot is da first song i ever heard someone give a shout out 2 quot louisiana quot much luv 4 dat although quot tell me somethin good quot appears twice on the cd pimp c remix is definitely somethin u can smoke treez 2 i cannot give enuff prop 2 ugk 4 what they 've done 4 da dirty south and everybody from da quot south quot should have this sh t n they house car b 4 master p b 4 scarface there wa u g mf k 

ugk ha been doin' their thing since the late 80 's and since then ugkworked hard representing the south texas rap scene in the mid late 90 's they finally gained some mainstream attention with 1996 's ridin' dirty a classic showcase of their skill 1992 's too hard to swallow is one hard bangin' album most production go to the late great pimp c with bun b and bismark adding some here and there creating a deep syrupy southern fried soundtrack to spit over pocket full of stone is an early crunk classic with a deep rollin' funky beat and thick bass many may remember it from the 1993 soundtrack menace ii society pocket wa also remixed with a sweet beat and censored lyric in 1993 included on 2002 's side hustle comp and there wa a dope part 2 on 1994 's classic super tight many of the other song here also deal with slanging and using drug like cocaine in the back of the ride and feel like i'm the one who 's doin' dope and those jam have a hard core dramatic soundscape for the rough lyric those style of beat would become standard in the early crunk movement that would soon ensue the title track take a more mellow approach but still with hard lyric the beat is similar more to twangy pre early g funk use me up is mid tempo funk with lyric dealing with being used or in pimp c 's word pimped by woman there are dirty song like the horny 976 bub b one misstep which could be easily skipped over is cramping my style with an overused and derivative isley brother between the sheet 1983 sample and a for the guest infinity i am not crazy about her verse i would have to say that pocket full of stone and it 's too hard to swallow are my favorite 2 here fan of true gangsta style rap and hard core lyric will definitely love this joint that came out in an era well before gangsta rap wa watered down with rnb diva hook and club beat it took quite a while before ugk ever got mainstream attention which they clearly deserved much earlier 

this is the first main stream cd that they dropped and today it 's still one of the hardest when i first heard 976 bun b in 93 i wa like this ca n't be real i had never heard anyone flow like this cat before and his style ha only gotten stronger bun b and pimp c are the duo way before outkast and all the other great to follow the thing is they just kept getting better with time if you have n't heard this you are missing out and the next up ridin dirty is a must have a well i wish i could get the tape samle to this cd that they released tell me something good had different word to it than what 's on the cd and 976 bun b had a different beat both were a lot harder i tell you i wish i could find out who stole it 

i have every ugk except this one but this one sound the best yo i even got to pick it up ugk always seems to amaze me keep it real bun b and pimp c and i look for your next albun in the 2000 

1 of tha mo t cla icc we t coa t gang ta rap albumz ever from tart 2 muthaf ckin fini h nuthin but that 510 icc hit on hit from mr ea t bay gang ta spice 1 every track iz tha hit dont sleep make sure 2 copp all hiz early material 

what can i say about this album that hasn`t been already said this wa a gift from old spigatee one this is just great west coast classic gangsta goodness 

this album wa spice 's second major label release and it is a good one not his best work but then it 's hard if according to me all of his album are worthy of 4 star at the least and most are 5 star classic production is good and handled by ant bank ea ski prodeje of south central cartel too hort dj xtra large and johnny z guest are few on 3 of the 14 song it ha 1 classic 2 near classic 9 good song and 1 that 's ok and 1 that i skip this wa recorded when he wa only about 22 but he hold it down for the east bay an album that you have to check it out 1 8 2 8 5 3 8 4 7 5 5 5 f bos 6 9 5 7 8 5 8 10 classic w mc eiht 9 9 f south central cartel 10 9 5 w e 40 ad libs in background 11 9 12 9 also on menace ii society soundtrack 13 8 5 14 9b robert lee green around 1971 b in texas moved to hayward ca ca n't fu k wit the easy bay g check out all my review 

a must own for any fan of that early 90 's west coast rap this one for you spice take you through with rhythmic wordplay and street knowledge a 

this album wa haaard the production is classic every song from the start to finish ha tight rhyme spice flow wa much more advanced from his first album which is a classic too i ca n't sat how much i like this cd i like what ant bank did with the 'george duke' sample on 'clip tha trigga' too since i used to like the original this is essential if you want good westcoast rap also checkout south central cartel 'n' gatz we truss' if you like this peace 

one of his earlier album old school gangsta music a must have for any 90 's gangsta rap child east bay 

i had never heard of spice 1 until a couple of month ago when i wa reading a listmania list on amazon com and spice 1 's 187 he wrote wa on it then all of a sudden i started seeing this album on more and more listmania list so i decided to check it out i wa expecting a mediocre album but this wa definetly worth the money i spent on it spice 1 ha a hardcore delivery and hardcore lyric he also show he can get deeper then just killing which is a skill that i have only seen in a couple of other gangsta rap artist such a the greatest rapper of all time scarface the only thing that hold this album back a little is the production i really wanted to hear spice 1 flow over a hardcore beat but only a couple time did it happen other then that this is a great cd it also sound pretty cool when he stutter in his verse like on the first song when one of the entire verse is him stuttering his word the best track are 187 he wrote clip trigga and trigga happy 

if i could rate this album 100 star i would there is no word to express the fact that this cd is slamming very hot very hot 

by time 1993 rolled around cat were getting a lot more lyrical in the hip hop lexicon it wa virtually a game of can you top this a several well oiled rhyming machine left mediocre stagnant rapper in a cloud of dust kr one ha always stayed ahead of the trend and return of the boom bap is no different in my opinion he is arguably rhyming tighter than he ever ha before his content strong message track weave excellently in and out of some of his finest lyricism to date the production is uniformly excellent and hit hard with a minimal and spare set of beat which is 100 boom bap the legendary dj premier who is also on top of his game produce most of the track here with kr one producing 4 track himself kid capri also produce 2 track and showbiz kill it on another all in all these element add up to an unstoppable force every track here is banana outta here black cop i ca n't wake up sound of da police higher level p is still free every track bang with a rugged raw fury this is hand down essential kr one material recognize the master 

the beat are crazy concept and rhyme are incredible these guy should do more album together the title track had me jumping all throughout my 10th grade b boying at it best kr 's best album by far it the complete package 

not really feeling this one a much a i thought i would considering everyone love this album i think his self titled album ha the better couple of premier beat on it then every beat on this album overall this one is mediocre for me 

leave it to kr one to teach what hip hop is supposed to sound like after dropping the boogie down production name kris come correct on his 1993 album return of the boom bap the production on here is pretty much on point courtesy of dj premier kid capri norty cotto and showbiz all those dope producer expect that signature east coast sound to represent a good number of track here are excellent track such a outta here slap them up and sound of the police if you can get the 12 that ha the b side hip hop v rap are easy standout mad crew is an easy headbanger along with p is still free another favorite of mine is brow skin woman kris misstep here on early point on this album like the boring sounding mortal thought and the odd concept of himself being a blunt being passed around to various rapper on i ca n't wake up a few others float around but that doe n't stop that from being a good album given that this is one that defiantly need to be in your music collection a this one would be in rotation for sometime peace lyric aproduction aguest appearance bmusical vibe b top 5 track 1 p is still free2 brown skin woman3 outta here4 mad crew5 slap them uphonorable mention 1 return of the boom bap2 sound of da police 

kr one 's first solo album is 1993 's return of the boom bap after the original six boogie down production album kr dropped the bdp moniker and dropped this gem kris enlisted the production of legend dj premier who only recently had begun to receive recognition for his musical genius a a member of gang starr the beat however while excellent are quite simple allowing kr one and his awesome character to take center stage he drop some of the political and social stance of the last two bdp album edutainmentandsex and violence in favor of a more entertaining and overall simpler approach that 's not to say that the verse are n't relevant his classic tale of police brutality urban injustice and hip hop loyalty are all here he just delivers them in a way that put the music and the performance to the forefront this is a totally classic album every song is totally memorable because kr put such a great performance on every track whether he 's screaming singing or toasting like a dancehall reggae performer he entertains first and foremost no track is even average or any worse than the others this is pretty close to a perfect hip hop album i could n't find you any flaw it 's arguably hip hop 's greatest mc teamed with arguably hip hop 's greatest producer a must have for the rap fan the album begin with an awesome intro kr one attack where premo lace a totally dope beat and cover it with some old bdp sample to make a perfect start outta here us simple drum and bass to allow kr to address the current state of hip hop chronicling his life a a rapper and talking about the tendency of rapper to fall off perhaps his best known song black cop follows here he is an entertainer first and an mc second yelling and screaming completely going wild on the mic anyone who ha n't sang along to the yelp of black coooop black cop black cop black cop should n't consider themself a hip hop fan mortal thought is relevant with a great chorus i love the conceptually genius i ca n't wake up where kr rap from the perspective of a blunt he namedrops most of the big name of '93 rap a the mc pas the blunt from rapper to rapper again he yell and sings a great chorus this song 's another classic the nice slap them up precedes the infamous sound of da police the look at police brutality is simply rap at it finest my favorite part is where he draw a connection between the similar sounding word overseer and officer in the second verse a they both oppressed the urban black community the chorus is just classic nobody else could ever pull this off like kr one mad crew ha a heavily sampled beat and uh oh us a human beatbox in favor of a drum machine brown skin woman delivers musically and lyrically and the following title track is just awesome 'p' is still free is once again classic material i remember first hearing this song on themenace ii society the original motion picture soundtrackcompilation the album end perfectly with stop frontin' and higher level a provocative challenge to american religion with a heavy horn laden beat i feel like this album get overlooked in comparison to the bdp album but i think this is a entertaining and enjoyable a anything kr one ha ever done a classic album in every sense of the word perfect hip hop from the best year for the genre 1993 if you have n't already do yourself a favor and pick it up 

this is probably the best solo album kr one ha ever put out sorry to say there are probably other good one but this is the best put together one the beat the rhyme and the material go together very nicely my favorite are outta here mortal thought i ca n't wake up sound of da police uh oh return of the boom bap and stop frontin' but the other song are good too i recommend this to fan of boogie down production or hip hop in general 

boogie down production leader kr one 's reputation began to slip in the early '90s a he spent more time educating than performing he hit back at his critic with the slamming return of the boom bap his first official solo release leaving behind the detailed production of the last bdp album sex and violence boom bap return the mc to the spare gritty territory of criminal minded kr one sound reinvigorated a well spitting out his rhyme with fury and intelligence although the record is n't a didatic a edutainment or sex and violence kr one ha n't made his lyric simplistic nor ha he abandoned his cutting intelligent social commentary the combination of hard basic beat and exciting rhyme make rerturn of the boom bap a genuine comeback for kr one one of the founding figure of modern hip hop 

return of the boom bap is a great classic it 's way up there with 93 til infinity by soul of mischief a future without a past by leader of the new school one for all ed o g and da bulldog first album and gang starr step in the arena it 's crafted beat on kr one album is by the talented dj premier it 's lyric is so great too check out sound of the police and mad crew this is a gifted classic with it 's old school loud bass original lyric definately a must have for any true hip hop head 

i wa a basshead and this album wa played quit a bit in the car especially the song in the middle of the album with a bass line that go and go just loved it also liked the idea of being passed around a a blunt overall the album ha some offbeat steady beat and slamming beat 

return of the boom bap return of the boom bap mean just that it mean return of the real hard beat and real rap released in the fall of 1993 kr one 's first official solo album is arguably his best in the early 90 's a new generation of west coast based mc became the superstar of rap while in the east act like naughty by nature and da efx were stealing the thunder of their 1980 's predecessor produced largely by gang starr 's dj premier return of the boom bap rejuvenates standard bearer kr one 's stance a the teacher of rap while giving him a more competitive stoop to stand on the lp 's first single outta here warns currently hot rapper that their material trapping may not last credit card and bank account outta here no doubt bdp is old school but we ai n't goin' out on the surreal i ca n't wake up kr see himself turned into a cigar while humorously name checking various early 90 's rap star the p is still free update a song from criminal minded about the lost soul of crack addiction the kid capri produced brown skin woman critique the sexism in rap and the lp 's biggest hit sound of da police produced by showbiz highlight the danger of police brutality in a post rodney king landscape the overseer had the right to get ill and if you fought back the overseer had the right to kill the officer ha the right to arrest and if you fight back they put a hole in your chest the most blazing track would have to be the album 's closer higher level with a blistering funk sample from the blacula soundtrack kr rant and raf about politics religion in the glorious fashion that only he can i stand with god whether i'm paid or whether i'm cry broke i like to ask these politician `would jesus vote ' at the time of it release the album and most others wa overshadowed by snoop doggy dogg 's doggystyle in comparison doggystyle may have slicker production value but boom bap 's jazz based rhythm track seem le dated and with far le gangster excess this deserves the deluxe re release treatment with any bonus material available 

overall this is a pretty good album with a few outstanding cut outta here i ca n't wake up and mortal thought are all fairly entertaining track that showcase kr one 's gifted delivery and his creative flow but the production of this record sound dated and alot of the song toward the end of the record are forgettable i prefer the hardcore leaning of his bdp day rather than these semi concious psuedo ragga party jam but kr 's voice is still a treat to listen to and this record is probably better than almost any other hip hop album put out in 1993 

kr 1 's best release after the bdp lp 's his subject matter is truly remarkable his visuals hypnotize you and take you to where the story is at the moment extremely dope around the board 10 star 

this wa one of the first hiphop album i ever purchased and i still listen to it today i think that kr 's style wa best suited to primo production once he lost primo with the exception of a few album he couldnt hold it anymore musicly kr didnt care about the latest trend in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop chart he just showed his incredible talent on the mic and stomped all the wack mc that deserved it this wa also the album that introduced the world to kr a a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his bdp day a well a few musical lyrical trick up his sleeve this album along with any other bdp release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngster out there who are just getting into hiphop this wa the era that i belive hiphop wa the best about 93 98 it a shame that kris is doing the crap he doing now i wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing album and continue his carrer a a live battle rapper 

god damn i have n't heard an album with so much effort and time put into it other classic were dropped before and after this but this is just a timeless classic i ca n't stress just how much this album reign supremacy kr one dropped 2 hot album with bdp criminal minded and by any mean necessary which were just off the hook but this is different his voice ha matured a lot more than what it wa in his earlier day and his lyric are thoughtful and excellent check out sound of da police to experiment his might and talent f ck tha police by n w a is by far the best dis song towards the police but this follows it right behind it i really like his 'overseer officer' rhyme and the way he rap in his jamaican way a he did back in criminal minded other cut enjoyed include outta here where he talk about his life in the game i ca n't wake up a pleasant track produced by premier uh oh using beatboxing a his instrument brown skinned woman where he put it down for the black brown nation and p is still free a song dedicated to the girl i like kr one for several reason but the strongest being that he 's one of the few rapper to understand real hip hop take a look at the title return of the boom bap it mean just that it 's the return of real rap he 's kept it true since '87 and still he 's doing it this is probably the best '93 rap album waay better than snoop dogg 's doggystyle it 's definately one of my favorite top 50 rap album of all time check this out coz kr one is out to attack best moment outta here i ca n't wake up sound of da police and brown skinned woman 

once again kr one brings it to you straight no chaser with help from dj premier and others you ca n't go wrong with this one my fave track 1 outta here2 sound of tha police4 higher level i love the lyric if you 're a early 90 's hip hop fan or just starting your collection i recommend this one 

what else can be said about this album that ha n't been said already this is basically a collaboration between two legend of the genre kr one and dj premier while both were at the top of their game it get no better than that period i feel kind of special because this is the kind of stuff i wa growing up on i think it wa 9th or 10th grade for me when this came out and i ran out and got this after hearing outta here for the first time sound of the police outta here return of the boom bap mortal thought black cop brown skin woman uh oh higher level i mean the list of classic on this disc go on and on the sound can best be described a bass heavy boom bap hence the title of the album kinda make me miss the early mid 90 's sound sigh a far a flaw i can only think of one i ca n't wake up that song wa a bit of a misstep otherwise the rest is straight fire anyone giving this le than 4 star doe n't know what a timeless piece this album truly is return of the boom bap is classic point blank period if you have n't heard this album yet then quit cheating yourself and check it out it may have come out in '93 but it sound just a fresh 13 year later i highly recommend making this one a collection piece standout track 'p' is still free slap them up black cop mad crew outta here brown skin woman sound of the police stop frontin' mortal thought uh oh higher level my favorite and return of the boom bap 

classic lyric 10 10production courtesy of d j premier 10 10theme 10 10album cover 10 10concept 10 10guest appearance nonestand out track outta hereoverall excellento kaka god's gift to da underground 

i have been a kr one fan for a long time and would have to say this is his best album sound of da police is completely off the hook the lyric are some of the best you 'll come across kr is one of the greatest rapper ever and this album is a timeless underground classic this is real hip hop dont support what we hear on the radio these day it all crap listen to legend like kr one and rakim other good track are kr one attack and return of da boombap beat 10 10lyrics 10 10production 10 10originality 10 10final note 5 mic classic one that all true rap hip hop fan have classic album one of the best of our time 

the most incredible album of 1993 far superior to snoop doggy dogg 's debut album which overshadowed this plus seemingly everything else at the time do yourself a favor and pick this up dj premier and kid capri 's production skill are not to be fronted on most blazing track higher level with a blistering sample from the blacula soundtrack kris rant and raf in the glorious fashion that only he can other outstanding cut kr one attack outta here sound of da police p is still free this is the first official solo album from kr one of boogie down production check out all his other album including the latest i got next 

the first album from kr one knowledge rein supreme that i loved on the first listen kr one attack blacc cop sound of da police mad crew p' is still free stop frontin' is insane higher level not for the dumb deaf blind outta here 

criminal minded by any mean return of the boom bap kr one self titled are the best album he ever did and made him the legend he is on this particular album he display his true lyricism such a metaphor battle rap etc this is definately far entertaining then previous release such a sex and violence edutainment and ghetto music those album came off to preachy in my opinion and do n't standout amongst his better effort a i mentioned before you can play the whole thing through although in my opinion the only track i would skip is uh oh because it 's a beatbox beat which get 's annoying after awhile other then that this is a classic album in hip hop and a landmark in it 's history 

true hip hop at it purest form wa being born wit kr 's return of the boom rap diz should already be in true head collection no weak joint a classic from a genious best track mad crew sound of the police and stop frontin a true classic 

some people seem to think that quot i got next quot is krs' best album but to my ear it pretty damn overrated this album demonstrates kr a the great clever lyricist he is and he is accompanied by nice production from one of hip hop 's finest dj premier he truly is the greatest emcee ever to touch a microphone he is the only emcee who 's a great today a he wa ten year back 

kr one returned with a vengeance in 93 and dropped a classic in the form of return of the boom bap this album like every other kr one album represents him in his truest form always talking about something positive claiming to be quot the teacher quot of hip hop and saying thing to leave you thinking here 's the review album highlight kr one attack outta here black cop mortal thought i ca n't wake up sound of da police mad crew and return of the boom bap production thumb up lyric and subject matter thumb up originality thumb up the last word while not a strong a criminal minded and by all mean necessary this is still kr at his best today he still remains one of the most influential mc out there keeping his legacy alive overall i recommend you pick up this album 

sh this album is off the hook outta here ha one of the best beat ive ever heard thats on a real hiphop tip right there kr one 's voice is better than ever and his lyric are on point every track kr one ha kept it real out of most emcee out of all these year you got to give him his repsect this guy is a true emcee and if you dont like him then go listen to your wack azz 50 cent album the production on this album is pretty much what give it it name grimey old school soundin hiphop beat if you want true hiphop better get this now real stuff all the song are on point my top 5 songs1 outta here nice 2 mortal thought3 i cant wake up4 return of the boom bap5 stop frontin 

you can trust me i 've heard all their music pimp c rip and bun b who are you if you have n't heard of these mc 's and this album 

the title wa taken from the bumping track front back side to side i purchased an old the source magazine from december 1994 and saw that wa a track for one of their sure hot single back in the day thing wa i never paid too much attention to ugk except for a few song here and there then ended up being the laughing stock at my job because i told them that i'm from the a their recent albumunderground kingzwas the only album i owned so i ended up buying this the very next day super tight is a very southern style album both bun b and pimp c sound way different back in '94 than they do today a lot of track would bump today a they did back then it 's supposed to bubble is one of them bun b drop a solo track fed in town which sound real good pocket full of stone 2 and protect serve are other good song stoned junkee is a very laid back and easy song to smoke to and feature 3 2 the final track three sixteen featuring dj dmd is a very good way to close out the album super tight is an excellent album some of the production sound dated although i have to give mad prop to pimp c for his production but it still bump here today it 's very unfortunate that this flew under the radar especially when other album from the south such assouthernplayalisticadillacmuzikandthe diarydropped the same year but if you 're a fan of 90 's southern rap mainly group like e s g ugk or anyone from rap a lot do n't hesitate to get this album i used to live in san antonio during my high school day '00 '04 and this album reminds me so much of how it wa down there in texas peace lyric a production b guest appearance b musical vibe a top 5 track 1 front back side to side2 three sixteen featuring dj dmd 3 it 's supposed to bubble4 stoned junkee featuring 3 2 5 return 

the whole cd is exactly what it say in the title super tight 4 real this ugk at it best 

ugk on their second album find the unstoppable riding groove that they are most known for today bun b 's rugged flow and menacing lyric nicely offset pimp c 's playalistic style the beat are strictly playa beat that you can ride to or just chill and bob ya head to never corny and always on point pimp c is definitely an underated producer every song bump but the classic are `return' it 's supposed to bubble i left it wet for you fed in town and front back side to side this album being nearly ten year old doe not have a dated sound and would n't sound out of wack on a mix cd of recent song it would fit right in and that my friend is a sign of timeless classic music ugk supertight 5 star 

the boyz from port arthur return after 2 year for their 2nd group album and their 2nd best album only 11 song but no weak point 1 classic 2 almost classic 2 are ok and the rest are good or great song guest are on 3 of the 11 song a usual for a ugk album the production is great and handled mostly by pimp c 9 song and dj dmd doe the other 2 they show why they 're the best group to come out of the south on this one and especially with their ridin dirty album a must have great album 1 10 classic hardcore song w great beat just over 2 minute 2 8 5 3 9 relaxing beat about dom p 4 9 5 great beat 5 8 about the fed in town 6 7 part 2 of pocket full of stone 7 7 8 9 9 8 f 3 2 about drug junky nice relaxing beat 10 8 f 3 2 about pu y 11 9 5 f dj dmd great beat bun b bernard freeman b 1973 port arthur txpimp c chad butler b 12 73 d 12 4 07 port arthur txunderground kingz check all my review 

this is some str8 killa from the kingz bun b and pimp c def show some real talent ability on this record easily up there w ridin' dirty too hard to swallow these guy have some of the tightest beat and rhyme out there 10 year later it 's still better than most s out there my fav track are i left it wet for ya underground fed in town it 's supposed to bubble they 're all tight super tight check this one out 

pimp c must have a helluva record collection to get at all of the sample the way he doe they got the lyrical skill alright but young chad 's production get slept on the neptune swizz beatz and others cant touch him him organized noize gangstarr 's premier and suave house 's old production team are perhaps the only one i can compare him to skillz wise this is a classic right here 

pimp c and bun b came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire this album slam from start to finish with that old school down south feel the beat are melodic g funk with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riff lyrically and vocally ugk kill in all department they really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flow the track fed in town is a gangster classic with a phat funky beat and tight scratch super tight is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switch down the avenue the mid 90 's wa one of the best period in rap history and this album is testament to it do n't sleep on this classic 

every thing about this album is super tight ugk is the real playas from down south i look for there next album ugk is taking it to the next millinuem 

see this is why i love west coast music too hort 's eighth album get in where you fit in is so funky word cannot explain how much i fell in love with this album i got into short dog back in 2000 with you nasty and felt that i should check out his earlier work this wa the very first album i picked up in his album before his retirement first too short 's rhyme skill are great throughout this album just about every song he really kick some dope rhyme whether if it 's about his pimp game bj betty would be used in a recent dtp song life in the ghetto street in oakland money in the ghetto or just in the day in the life of ol' short dog just another day production is perfect curteosy of the dangerous crew ant bank and qdiii who produced ice cube 's lethal injection album qd iii produce only one track just another day and that track clock in about 7 minute of funk some other funky produced track throughout this album is the dangerous crew money in the ghetto all of these track are well produced i 've been listening to rap music for a long time and i 'd say when it come to production in album this would be ranked in my top 5 it 's that good i ca n't stress that enough guest appearance also bring their a game the dangerous crew would feature bay area arists spice 1 i might want to look into this guy too ant bank mhisani and pee wee ant bank also appears on all my are gone he say the tighest line towards the end of the song flaw are very little if you can find any if you 're one of those people who get offended by derogitory comment toward woman you might not want to come near this or any other too short album other than that this album is perfect i purchased this album about 5 month ago and it easily became in my top favorite this is also my first too short album pre retirement and i 'd say i made a very good choice here if you 're reading the review here you need to click the add to cart button right now at the price it 's listed right now 9 99 damn near a steal if you ask me there should be no excuse of why you 're not going to pick up this album it 's album like this that make me wish i lived in oakland lyric a production a guest appearance a musical vibe a overall a favorite track all thirteen track are my favorite 

too short is respected a a legend for being one of the west coast 's first mc and get unconditional love from the bay his eighth album is 1993 's get in where you fit in a fine showcase of one of rap 's most unique character back in '93 classic hip hop lp were dropping by the week and too short 's dangerous crew created a presence with their funk based oakland sound ant bank deserves a co credit for this lp for mastering the pure ungangstafied funk that wa the dangerous crew 's trademark true to his formula the song have no hook or recognizable structure so sometimes they drag on especially since all but two track approach six minute or more but the bass heavy twangy funk is endlessly enjoyable with live instrumental break clever sample and thumping percussion banks' funk is n't soulful or smooth like long beach 's g funk it 's heavy deep live and tight musically this is one of banks' best work comparable to his solo effort it 's business a usual for shorty on the mic the topic at hand are pimping his sexcapade and prowess with the lady short 's pimp persona is by this point familiar but still fun a he tell long winding story over ant banks' track he is one dimensional but at this point in his career the dangerous crew wa in full effect and frequent guest include ant bank goldy rappin' ron and ant diddley dog i'm a player is the opening highlight a pumping statement from both short and bank just another day produced excellently by qdiii chronicle a day that includes hustling in oakland a post game party at gary payton 's house and a concert in new orleans gotta get some lovin' recount a dry spell over a spage age banger and bank cleverly flip well known sample for money in the ghetto and bj betty bank and short trade off verse over all my b are gone 's twangy lick and the whole dangerous crew show up for the dangerous crew and the title track the latter a 9 minute dis at former member pooh man check outai n't no lovefor the comeback short prof time and time again that he can flow for day and he is frequently a force on the mic a his story defy any convention short and bank are a great match and their music is completely unique and creative get in where you fit in is n't a lyrical masterpiece by any mean but what short lack in lyricism he make up for in style and ant banks' beat it 's hard to compare an album like this to the classic of '93 because it relies on a different formula of music and style in any event it is a good listen that i recommend over too short 's long and winding career his music ha become reheated and derivative but i think his best day were with bank and the dangerous crew so this is an album i 'd check out if you 're new to too short he 's a better character than rapper but he 's one of rap 's most prolific and influential mc and it 's hard to argue with this funk good music for the ride party or just relaxing 

definetly too hort's best album this sh iz funky laid back all the way thru w that dangerous crew mackin game feat ant bank spice 1 goldy rappin ron more make sure 2 copp this clasicc 

get in where you fit in is not only my favorite album by too short but definitely one of my all time favorite hip hop record the first six track of the album start the lp off with a bang while it kinda slows down later on i'm a player and just another day are what made me want to buy this year ago i'm not into the new stuff short 's doing these day but i always listen to the golden age short 88 94 or 95 short dog 's best bar none 

wow the oaktown pimp really went overboard with album 8 just 15 month since his last album he come with his best and funkiest album of all 15 with 13 song of straight funk it ha 3 classic 2 almost classic and the rest are real good or great song guest are n't all over just on most the last half of the album and it is mostly his dangerous crew clique the production is great in the word of dj quik it 's way 2 fonky every song ha an unreal beat and the dangerous crew posse is to thank a well a 1 great track by qdii ant bank doe 5 song and the dangerous crew doe 7 no wonder this may be the best produced album i ever heard and i have over 675 rap album ant bank dangerous crew and qdii no word here just listen and you 'll understand a must have album for all 1 8 5 short amount of rapping and alot of talkin but tight nice beat a well 2 9 about him being player good beat 3 11 classic great beat and 7 minute of funk 4 9 dirty songa bout having no ho 's tight beat 5 8 about money in da hood 6 10 classic and his dirtiest song ever nice raggae beat 7 8 5 f ant bank tight beat about how al his biaaatches are gone 8 9 5 f spice 1 goldy ant bank pee wee the dangerous crew great beat 9 8 5 f rappin ron r i p ant diddley dog dissin pooh man 10 10 classic w great beat 11 9 5 f father dom ant bank tight beat 12 9 f leslie calaway nice beat 13 8 fm blue f too hort todd shaw b 4 29 66 b los angeles ca moved to oakland cacheck all my reviewsbiaaaatch 

what i like about hort dog is that throughout all of his material and extensive career in rap he remains real keepin it real now a day is a cliche but hort always remained true to the music he make buying every too hort lp would be a library in it own although i do recommend doing so if you have n't picked up anything from him yet you have to buy this record hand down my favorite release from him 

too short had flow like no other rapper in the game hit like i'm a player payboy short and get in where you fit in i give it 5 out of 5 

15 year after this album came out and i am still enjoying this release the first time i heard the lyric of i'm a player i wa in high school and it took me 2 day to learn the lyric that 's how much i wa listening to this album the beat are dope and too short 's lazy flow is right on point this album is a classic it is probably my favorite too short album next to life is too short and cocktail definitely a must for your collection 

too hort is the biggest pimp ever and always will be even though he doe n't rap about much else for some reason it never get old listening to short dog possibly because ant bank provides some of the funkiest beat or maybe it 's too hort 's delivery and voice but i will never get tired of listening to too hort this album is his best edging out life is too short and cocktail it ha the best production and too hort and company drop hot lyric over the beat bay area rap doe n't get much better 

this is too short 's greatest album man it banging from start to finish a couple of the song are too long but that 's the only fault just another day and gotta get some lovin' are too of the funkiest beat ever keep on pimpin' short 

man again and again too hort never fails to deliver at this time which wa about 93 too hort wa runnin the oakland rap game funky as hell strait oaktown style like the rest of his real funk this is where it att track are all i like tha intro and the outro 

too short definitely ha had a great mainstay in hip hop today and ha had one a early a 1993 his 8th album get in where you fit in too short continues his formula of vocal pimpin on wax and the sale do not lie he ha sold million of record with his simple but engaging flow his flow complement the syrupy g funk beat courtesy of ant bank one of my fav 's qdiii another great the dangerous crew my favorite short song of all time is here on just another day qdiii lace a smooth twangy funk beat with a great whiny synth in the hook on this 7 1 2 minute classic short doe a great job telling his life on tour all across the hood of the u s a similar song is dj quik 's jus lyke compton from his 1992 classic way 2 fonky where he tell the tale of touring all thru the u s hood i love way too real where short get it raw and trill over an immaculate ant bank lowrider ready beat gotta get some lovin' is where short is horny and is sick of not having a woman to fool with over a slick syrupy beat it 's hella funny bj betty is raunchy i believe it is a remake of an 80 's song he made but do n't quote me on that all my b s are gone is self explanatory with a twangy ant bank beat where you 'll ride slow loud and bangin' to on the avenue pimp rap is not new in 1993 and especially to short dog but his charisma and the g funk beat definitely make the album a definitely classic bank and short ddefinitely have great chemistry and i am glad to say they done made a lotta song together 

theoretically r kelly 's debut album a a solo artist anyway is very crucial for the development of music in the 90 's it wa transitional music easing out of the hip hop based new jack swing style of the beginning of the decade towards what would eventually be known a neo soul a largely retro funk based sound usually informed by hip hop rather than being dependant on it creatively r kelly embodies many of the quality of the r b soul funk great that came before him he 's a songwriter vocalist with a strong flair for song construction and strong gospel informed singing and most importantly perhaps a multi instrumentalist with the ability to create sturdy groove and for example the good sense to bring in jazz guitarist bobby broom to play on your body 's callin' lyrically this album blend the sacred and the secular in the classic soul tradition it wa a quality he 'd maintain throughout his career bump n grind wa of course the big hit and the album followed that excellent groove for the most part in the same manner for you it seems like your ready and the extended jam sex me all follow that same basic mid tempo neo funk groove to a tee this album also includes a touching story song type tribute to his mother in sadie full of gospel organ and all kind of soulful break and release the same go musically for the closing title song the main difference is that one a with the rest of the album is based in heavy duty bedroom music visually explicit without the use of explicit language the interesting part is a pointed out in many review the album is actually one of the few of it 's type i 've heard where the album loses some energy when the tempo pick up with the exception of the strong summer bunny the majority of the uptempo cut such a homie lover friend freak dat body back to the hood of thing and i like the crotch on you feature rap by deandre boykins and carey kelly that are very repetitive and very uninteresting since this album wa at it 's time looking to innovate to a degree the inclusion of rapping on these song kind of seemed like a step back and in the future kelly would come to do much much better at utilizing hip hop in his music for the longest time i thought of r kelly a a bit of a one trick pony who wa likely not very capable of delivering anything close to a consistant album after all that tended to be a problem for a lot of music of this particular era for those i will have to say this album will certainly prove those naysayer wrong including myself 

this is one of r kelly's best album i enjoy this album it contains some nice song body's callin homie lover friend sex me bump n' grind this is a nice mix i enjoy this album if you are an r kelly fan i would definitely recommend that you purchase this album it is a must have for any r kelly fan 

i first discovered r kelly and his talent back in 1995 two year after 12 play wa released i listened to 12 play dozen of time and i just became overwhelmed by his skill and his raunchy lryics released in 1993 12 play wa where r kelly became a true r b superstar it wa a concept album that showcased his talent and versatility perfectly the opening track your body 's callin' is a classic it 's a smooth and sexy ballad with airy instrumentation and the amazing vocal bump and grind is another song that will go down a his most popular tune the song ha memorable bouncy beat and throbbing lyric that make this an instant classic homie lover friend freak dat body and back to the hood of thing all show off his rapping skill with the g funk inspired beat and the awesome hook it seems like you 're ready is a slow jam with r setting the bar high on his romantic persona i like the crotch on you is another one of kelly 's x rated themed song with the g funk inspired rhythm but after half of the song end he tone it down by singing with other male vocalist about the con who hate his music he also play the piano on there summer bunny is an upbeat song about the lady for you is a personal favorite of mine it 's a nice ballad with smoothed out vocal romantic spanish guitar and the lushy string sadie ha r doing a cover song of the spinners' classic he wonderfully dedicates the song to his mother sex me is an 11 minute epic that ha r singing the most notorious lyric of his career it 's a well crafted ballad with the airy synthesizer bumpy drumming and spacey vocal the title track 12 play is what i consider to be the climax of the whole album it 's a lovely slow jam with memorable hook overall all i can say about 12 play is that it 's kelly 's most raunchest and unified album in every sense his 2000 album tp 2 com the sequel to this album 12 play might 've been more sexually explicit and thugged out but 12 play just took him to a whole new level bringing him to a mainstream audience and redefining his image i really think it 's a 1990 's r b classic and one of r kelly 's best recording a 

do n't be too mad at me but i really just discovered 12 play about a few week ago i 've really been 'into' music the past few year i feel it important to go back and listen to the 'real' music this cd ha always been in my house but never listened to it i mean who doe n't kno bump and grind your body 's callin it seems like you ready but to me those are n't the only good one on the cd i love the uptempo jam like homie lover friend freak dat body my fave uptempo being summer bunny it just scream old summer jam but besides the obvious the good song all the release sex me and 12 play are just so damn good there ha never been an r b cd since this and it 's a tough act to follow 

a the album title 12 play insist on sexual connotation it is a lot more than just that 12 play is r kelly 's first solo album second overall he make a dedication to his mother on the sensational remake sadie for you is a simple r b love song of being a shoulder for someone robert also take u to the earlier year of his life on back to the hood of thing featuring additional flow of deandre boykins carey kelly you can also hear him flow distinctly on homie lover friend the weather never felt a hot a stated on summer bunny out taking in some sunray then a night fall upon the summer he ha something for the lady to dance to a r kelly show them how he 'll freak dat body a for the slow jam that invite the mood all there 's to say is good night 

do you mind if i give you some of my 12 play what else can i say about the king this album is a true rnb classic i listen to this album and i hear the passion in his voice the seduction in the production and the bad rapping but when it the 'r' you can forgive him for a few blunder i e i like the crotch on you and back to the hood of thing ugh nevertheless this album is pure brilliance love him or like him he just may be the greatest rnb artist of all time 

sup my people from the chi this cd is over 10 year old and still play in my cd player often he ha the best talent out of any r b artist he ha inspired many others but ha extrememly sexual lyric this is a must have if you 're collecting r kelly cd 's 

this is probably r kelly best work to date i still love the song from this album 

i remember being twelve year old when the 12 play album came out at the time there really wa no other male r b singer doing it like mr kelly expect for my boy ralph tresvant a i 've said in other review r kelly 's ballad are what make the cd work of course everyone know the single your body 's callin it seems like you 're ready bump grind sex me part 1 2 but there wa also the self titled track the heart felt cover of sadie and the sentimental for you the up tempo stuff is really weak but the ballad are on point 

well i did not order this one from amazon actually i picked this up way before i wa even shopping on amazon but amazon is still the bomb anyway i picked this cd up when it first came out in the 90 's and it is still on rotation in my cd changer the lady love it and so do i now i realize that r kelly is in a little trouble but hey no one is perfect and we 've all done thing we are not proud of so i 'll continue to support his music i'm not sure what he doe in his personal life but i 'll say this what he doe inside the studio allows me to do what i gotta do inside the crib ymmv neosoul06 

when 12 play first came out it wa an absolute classic however i have n't listen to it for a long time and wa surprised at how dated it is homie lover friend bump n grind and your body 's callin' are the best cut homie lover friend really connects with me because that is what i am looking for maybe one day i 'll find her 

r kelly 12 play jive 1993 many people claim that they grew up listening to r kelly but when asked what song are favorite if you say thoinga thoing or fiesta then you 're just a young'un because ten year ago before all that pied piper hogwash r kelly bald head and all had lady and fella swooning with this his second album the classic are all on here like it seems like you 're ready sex me pt i ii and bump n' grind the rap that he do on here are also an improvement off of his first album one big classic check it out ejr 

r kelly ha always been a great producer and songwriter and at least a plausible if not extraordinary singer though numerous legal woe have hampered his success over the past several year he nonetheless got off to a really great start with his first album which ha a plethora of sexual undertone but still manages to sound more stylish than trashy contains the 1 hit bump 'n grind and the urban radio favorite your body 's callin' and it seems like you 're ready there is also a brilliant remix of bump 'n grind on the single for that song entitled the definition of a hotti remix this wa played a lot on my local radio station and for those of you who have n't heard it i strongly recommend it is more blissful and sensual than the original in my opinion 

there 's a couple of track that i skip over but for the most part this wa a great debut another classic to anyone 's cd collection 

i really liked this cd quot bump n grind quot and quot sex me quot are gonna be on people 's mind for a long time the only time r start slipping is when he try to rap sorry r but you ai n't got it the one about his mother quot sadie quot wa so sweet and sentimental a good album all around 

the man is prince teddy pendergrass in one the difinitive r amp b album of the '90 's is still a banger to this day 

this wa the first album without those clown oops i mean other men public announcement a you can see a clear a the sun shine this man ha talent but do n't take my word for it take a listen your body 's callin' wa a banger no doubt but the remix wa hotter than fire bump and grind wa a good one too but the remix wa off the chain with lyric like i got what you want you got what i need homeyloverfriends is all i wanna be it 's the pretty brown brown driving me wild oooh child thing are gonna get a little freakier plus the dance the butterfly wa out then too it seems like you 're ready freak dat body wa forgettable a so wa i like the crotch on you summer bunny wa ho hum for you wa another sleeper back to the hood of thing is where rkelly decided to become a temporary thug of which he discovers the only thing he is really exceptional at is being a freak sadie is a nice cover which i presume is wa dedicated to his mother sex me pt 1 2 the best song on the album period lyric were sexually laced not for the faint of heart kelly let you know what 's on his mind and what he plan to do about it go get this album and reminisce 

a mix of both slow and mid tempo though mostly slow song of faith love and desire quot homie lover friend quot express every person 's desire to have someone that they can have fun with a a quot homie quot make love to a a quot lover quot and trust a a quot friend quot classic song include quot bump n grind quot quot sex me quot and quot your body 's callin' quot listen to this on the beach while you 're relaxing or when you turn out the light with that special someone 

i have got to say that this album ha brought me back during my high school day i grew up listening to him and other artist such a keith sweat i remember attending to his concert in radio city music hall performing with salt n pepper right after prom night kelly doe almost everything by himself the production songwriting and mix 's etc and he 's brilliant a a multi instrumentalist every fan of r b and soul will love this smooth laid back music i mean who can forget classic like your body 's callin' and bump n' grind song that just make your head bounce do n't forget the best r b song of 1993 sex me for it seductive made for lover in bed sound other very good low tempo song are it seems like you 're ready for you 12 play and sadie it wa with the album 12 play that he acknowledged his real music and showed the world his enormous talent overall 12 play is a very good album and although released in 1993 it can stand up to anything on the r b market now this is a very sexy album great for all kind of lover i definitely recommend this to all kelly fan 

just a classic cd on this one wow from start to finish this album is just loaded with track from quot your body 's callin' quot to quot 12 play quot my favorite track is quot seems like your ready quot a slept on classic song to me this is where r kelly start production spree of song from hi five 's quot quality time quot on of course the two stand out song with the remixes for quot bump amp grind quot amp your body 's callin' quot so please get this one because it is a definite ca n't miss 

12 play is the debut album from r kelly this album is great if you love r b and sexual theme your body 's callin bump n' grind homie lover friend summer bunny 12 play and sadie are my favorite song the rest of the album is good too r kelly ha a very strong voice and he produce writes and arranges all of his music which make him a very versatile artist if your just getting into r kelly i recommend these chocolate factorytp 2 comr the r in r b collection vol 1r kellyhappy people u saved meand robert 's new album tp 3 reloaded is real good song on that album that i recommend listening to are playa 's only all of the trapped in the closet chapter remote control sex weed and sex in the kitchen 

who doe n't have this cd this is like a required element of any r amp b lover 's collection of course r kelly is well known for his quot bump n grind quot kind of love song and this is the one that actually ha it anyone who want to set the sexy scene with the right kind of music here 's what you must have 

12 play wa r kelly 's first real solo album unless we count born into the '90s with public announcement that pretty much wa r kelly 's affair all the way but on 12 play it get 's more evident that r kelly is the man behind the music and he sings what he want to the new jack swing is mostly gone and the main theme is smooth midtempo 's with a theme about sex infact it 's one of the most sexual album since prince quite a few song still feauture a guest rapper but it doe n't take away anything from him on the musical side here he prof that he 's a musical genius and that he 's here to stay say what you want about him but the production here is a class of it 's own 12 play start with your body 's calling a slick pleading mid tempo about you know what this wa one of the biggest hit of the album bump and grind go one step further and it 's even better it got effective beat and r kelly singing i do n't see nothing wrong with a little bump n grund homie lover friend is a midtempo that feature a rapper the song sound taken from the early 90 's and resembles alot of song from born into the 90 's it seems like you 're ready is another excellent number it 's one of those seductive on the limit song that could have been penned by mr marvin gaye back in the day r kelly deliver his most sensitive lyric here great making love song for sure freak dat booty also feautures a rapper and the song is more of a uptempo party track not that good actually consudering that during the last few year we 've heard a million of simular song but i suppose that back in 1993 it wa diffrent i like that crotch on you is simular a mid tempo with a rapper could have been on the previous album also summer bunny also feauture a rapper but this song is more of a uptempo and the rap is more prpriate here it 's one of the highlight here reminds me a little of the latter only the loot can make me happy but this one is entirely dedicated to girl for you is a very slow romantic song not to be mistaken for strip for you back to the hood of thing with snoop and dr dre doe n't sound like anything from this album and in this case it feel out of space here better for a latter album perhaps sadie is a slow urban number that add weight to the album sex me is right on the spot and doe n't hide anything it 's delivered in 2 version together they are 10 minute and resembles good old prince music 12 inch play continues where sex me left off odd that the title track is the last song either way it 's a slow seductive song that close a great album well overall r kelly finally released a real solo album and he did it with great result the album wa a major hit and launched several hit single a well the theme is simple s e x but sex sell and it 's produced with first class this album is much better then tp2 and tp3 and it wa the album that made r kelly a superstar say what you want about him and his scandal but when it come to music he 's a genius and he prof it here 

if you are a fan of r b music there is no way you can give this album le than 5 star it 's a classic the crazy thing is it 's not even r kelly 's best album that honour belongs to his self titled 1995 release 12 play boast the smash hit your body 's callin and bump n grind but it also includes other quality track like summer bunny sex me and it seems like your ready there is also a great tribute song called sadie which is a nice change up from the sexually charged theme of the album this album really launched the career of r kelly and put him on the map a one of the powerhouse r b act of the 1990 's and early 2000 's high recommend 

i would say that i like 40 of this album to me that 's not enough but i would purchase it b c the 3 4 i like on there is worth the purchase 

this is a cd that no matter who im with pull this one out and everyone know the song and love this cd you can never go wrong with 12 play every r b fan need this cd to complete thier collection it is a must have there are a few song i dont like but all the hit on this cd more than make up for them and he still get 5 star because in my opinion some of the best song of our time are on this cd another one of those road trip cd to play with old friend everyone i know love this cd 

i started to like him when i listen to his cd r after that i bought all of his old cd when i bought this one i knew it wa going to be nasty but that 's how it wa this cd sound great and if you are a big fan like me then you should buy it don't burn it because it is worth it 

r kelly really stepped thing up with this his debut solo effort without the support of public announcement the previous lp had showcased moment like she 's got that vibe but had a lot of room for improvement and self expression the focus here is almost totally on the 90 party romance r b sound he pause only to honour his mother and is full of classic in this respective genre bump n' grind wa the big hit and a definite anthemic highlight a he lay down his manifesto other well known material includes your body 's calling me and it seems like your ready both are beautifully structured and performed track five to nine bring a more uptempo feel with a slight new jack twist carrying on from 1992 's born into the 90 the album reach it 's climax on the final two number the bedroom suite of the near twelve minute opus sex me part 1 2 and 12 play it 's all really well done you can tell he had really studied the epic nature of marvin gaye 's 70 work which lead into the one minor complaint he did n't seem to have found his own distinctive sound at this stage his vocal echo aaron hall while the production at time teddy riley that said this problem is n't a acute a on the last lp and the material is great on it 's own merit even though he would go on to find his own voice and style on his next album 1995 's self titled effort do n't sleep on 12 play it 's full of gem 

what can i say r kelly is just an amazing talent his voice his creativity is simply amazing this man is a god blessed vocalist and i pray he continues to shine and bring forth music love it 

he 's kels he 's the r in r b he 's r r kelly and robert kelly and this lady and gentleman is the album that made him it 's called 12 play it wa released in 1993 which wa a very good year for kelly this is a must have album for any r b fan because r kelly did such a great job i enjoy listening to this album the slower song in particular in fact the faster song sound very dated and they are the key reason i could only give this album 3 star if this album wa built on only his slower sexier star it would easily be 5 star homie lover friend and freak dat body are example of the dated material i am speaking of here kelly try to rap when clearly his forte is singing and producing summer bunny is the only up tempo song that is good this is a very sexually driven piece of work but that 's alright because r kelly is sexy and he know how to croon well he 's a little more blatant than his colleague like jaheim donell jones and tevin campbell sex me 12 play your body 's calling and seems like your ready are so sensual they would set the mood perfectly for a romantic evening overall this is a nice album and i recommend it to all mikeisha 's top 51 bump n grind2 your body 's calling3 sadie4 summer bunnies5 12 play 

this one still sound the best to me of all his other release your body callin bump amp grind 12 play he is a very talented writer amp producer 

this is the best r kelly cd ever in my opinion it hard to pin point r kelly because he really ha written produced and remixed some of the best song out he is the closest musical genius right under prince 

all right i may be the only person in america who ha n't seen the tape and therefore i still declare the man innocent until proven guilty a to the song pertaining to one adult to another then this is a good cd if the song are pertaining to one adult to a child then this is a sick cd 

if you love r amp b then this is your first must have disc 12play is the cd that put r kelly on the map and rightfully so this is a classic r amp b disc and could 've been with only five song on it your body 's callin bump n grind it seems like you 're ready sex me i amp ii and 12play simply define this disc it seems like you 're ready wa an instant r amp b classic and is still being played on the radio today everyone ha to love sex me just for it 's production if nothing else i wo n't tell too much i 'll let the customer experience it for themselves those who have the album know what i mean and those who do n't should be on their way to the record store right now definitely buy 12play 

born into the 90 by public announcement introduced r kelly to the world r kelly later felt he needed to branch out and do his own solo thing smart move because he ha been on the rise afterwards say what you will about r kelly but he contributed immensely to r b and we have to give credit where it is due a lot of these group now are inspired by him a much a some of them wont admit it your body 's callin and bump 'n grind yeah i said it the hell with corny a vh1 and blender ragazine it seems like your ready for you sex me part 1 2 and the title track are what r kelly excels at the slow jam he doe fairly well on fast groove like summer bunny and homie lover friend sadie is the best farewell song to a mother that i 've ever heard his mother had passed on a much a i like this album i cant give it five star i like the crotch on you is laughably cheesy freak dat body ha a slammin beat and nothing else and back to the hood of thing should have never been attempted a r kelly bust cornball verse like for real yo you making me nervous and im about to knock you in your teefes regardless of these misstep 12 play is still a great album by a guy who didnt start making questionable release until the 2000 r kelly is one of the artist that defined 90 r b so you would do well to have this album standouts your body's callin bump 'n grind it seems like you're ready summer bunny for you sadie sex me part 1 2 and 12 play 

r kelly is a master of taking a completely juvenile sexual song title like quot i like the crotch on you quot and flipping it with his smooth voice into some kind of bizarre love song quot 12 play quot his first album without the assistance of public announcement prof that he could hold his own rolling solo and while it is n't a polished or a popular a his later hit making lp it 's a solid release nonetheless the album kick off with the smooth groovin' quot your body 's callin' quot from there it 's on the hit single quot bump n grind quot the hip hop inflected quot homie lover friend quot and the first of many slow sticky ballad quot it seems like you 're ready quot the back half of the album ha most of the better song track like the flossy quot summer bunny quot and the uptempo quot back to the hood of thing quot are perfect for riding around on a hot summer 's day watchin' honey also quot sex me pt i amp ii quot succeeds despite the fact that it 's one song followed immediately by a remix of the exact same song that wa kind of a bone headed move on the part of the producer but it work nonetheless however the pinnacle of the album come in the form of a complete departure from the rest of the album quot sadie quot an ode to kelly 's mother is a beautiful mid tempo ballad that make you forget that he spent the rest of the album trying to get in your woman 's panty all in all the sound of this album is a little dated it 's definitely early '90s r amp b with some hip hop thrown in for effect but it wa a step towards defining the r amp b giant that would soon be r quot i wish i could fly quot kelly 

r kelly 's 12 play album still hold up over a decade later did n't like it at first because it overdoes it on the bump and grind song and sexy theme it 's steamy on a number of song especially sex me it seems that you 're ready your body 's callin' the popular bump and grind and others but one of my favorite is not like that it 's sadie r 's remake of the spinners' '70s classic and i ca n't help but cry when i hear it because he really sings it with soul after his album came out there were flood of r b artist riding on the steamy theme of it in late 93 and early '94 but when the smoke cleared this album still hold up this set the tone for his producing of later hit with his one man band signature sound for people like aaliyah changing face and others otherwise this album would be best heard when making love in the bedroom at 1 44 am in the morning 

12 play ruled the airwave in 93 r kelly killed all of his aaron hall impersonation from born into the 90 's and dropped this classic baby making sex fest on wax top joint sex me both 12 playit seam like you 're readybump and grindyour body 's callin 

stop hating on r kelly he achieved a lot during his prime for you so called r kelly fan to back stab him like that just for that sex scandal that probably wa n't true stop hating stop lying and shut yor f'n mouth for good 

my favorite r kelly cd to date a note trapped on track 8 is an overlooked but great song called quot for you quot that i'm sure you will play over amp over trust me 

you can pretty much tell r kelly did this entire record from the sizzling throw your hand up to the infectious remix of back forth this record will down a one of r kelly 's best producing project and that ha always been it drawback the production and arrangement outshining aaliyah 's flourishing talent a a vocalist however that did n't halt aaliyah 's popularity a displayed by three huge hit back forth age ai n't nothin' but a number at your best with back forth topping the chart not bad for a 15 year old first timer the single are the highlight but the album track are just a good if not better than the single my favorite include street thing one of the few time aaliyah take control of a record in convincing manner young nation a lush groove wrapped around aaliyah 's tender voice and old school a slick groove featuring r kelly rapping what 's most amazing about this record is that aaliyah wa only 15 at the time of it release it clearly showed that she wa going to be a major star regardless if she had the best behind and in front of the board the two worked hand n hand to produce not only a hit record but a timeless classic in the hip hop soul genre in addition this record ushered in a slew of other great '94 album changing face tlc boyz ii men blackgirl immature to really kick off the hip hop soul genre highly recommended for hip hop head and r b music junky 

musical prejudice come in many different form in my own case it came in the form of seeing album such a this and simply assuming it wa just one of the many new jill female artist that seemed to be saturating the musical world in the early mid 1990 's maybe to a certain degree that wa true for aaliyah in the beginning on the other hand she wa much more than that from the get go for starter she courted controversy a being the teenage wife to the by this time very adult r kelly so the obvious wa on the mind of a lot of people that her record contract came along with the engagement ring only r himself would know the truth about that today at the same time he certainly had an eye for a talent in growth and nearly ready to bloom this album wa very much a musical byproduct of r kelly 's12 playera he wa still musically running a bit with the crowd and had n't established his own voice so it 's no surprise that some of these song such a back and forth down with the clique young nation and old school are very much artifact of the new jack hip hop soul era especially in rhythmic term on the rhythmically layored slower jam of the title song representing how the new jack ballad genre stuck pretty close to a mid late 80 's sound and at your best a more live sounding ballad you hear a beauty and charm in aaliyah 's verstile pipe that would very much come to define who she 'd be in the future kelly had the good sense to present her singing acapella on some of the interlude to showcase her talent so is this an ideal debut for aaliyah no the album title may have emphasized that age ai n't nothing but a number but her age wa in fact at the very key of this album while she doe have a percocious manner about her aaliyah is still at this point coming at her song from the point of view of a high school age person looking to be grown up in her case on more of an urban street level her attitude is not particularly angsty though and that 's very appealing she tends to be enthusiastic and explorative on a darker note she also came off a endlessly resiliant with a perception life would be longer than it would be and in her case it wa inhumanly short i 'll tell you but the small amount of music she released in her short time in life starting with this told a story of creative growth and earnestness 

this cd is one of those throwback to the 90 's that ha really held true yes it sound like what it is a dated r b rap album created by a very talented young woman r i p aaliyah but it sound so much better than similar album of it type and era which make me wonder what more would have come from this woman some track are cringe worthy but they will all make you nod your head once again 

i got this cd for my birthday which is 4 day before aaliyah 's i first saw and heard aaliyah in her video back forth and i loved her automatically a a 7 year old i thought of her a a role model i always thought she wa so beautiful and talented so it 's no wonder i'm still mourning this loss way into 2002 it 's like i lost a friend anyway this cd is very 90 's sounding which is what i miss in music today my favorite song on the album is at your best you are love because it 's a very touching ballad with wonderful background music check out the remix of this song too i love back forth both of 'em age ai n't nothing but a number down with the clique old school i'm down and all the other song i did n't mention buy this cd cuz it 's a definite collector 's item for all aaliyah fan r i p aaliyah january 16 1979 august 25 2001 

this album came out when i wa 14 i'm 21 now and i still listen to it a lot in fact it 's my favorite aaliyah album all the song are great of course since r kelly wrote them and aaliyah sings them beautifully the best song are the title track quot back and forth quot and quot at your best you are love quot all the other song are great too 

with r kelly in the backround whatever aaliyah lack it made up by resource in the team that surround here there are definately some good song on here this is just the beginning for this chicago based musician great thing are coming 

well i liked this cd a lot someone that i did n't know purchased it for me off of my wishlist you can buy me something for me too if you like and when i got it i listened to it all the way through i 've been an aaliyah fan since quot back and forth quot and i 'd heard some song on this album but not the whole thing so this wa really a treat for me i liked the cd and the beat it really did have quot a 90 swing quot the only thing i did n't like wa r kelly all over it i 've always disliked r kelly and i think that the best only thing he ever did wa aaliyah the album though and the content wa really immature which wa n't rare for album that came out in the 1994 period but i still liked it it wa pretty good but my favorite is still quot back and forth quot d 

aaliyah came out when she wa 15 and had some great hip hop laced r b cut with help from r kelly her mentor and rumored husband aaliyah had a certain charisma and smooth delivery that made up for her sometimes immature lyric which wa not her fault still this cd wa very important in the mid 90 's age ai n't nothing but a number back and forth and at your best you are love were her single but i wa also impressed by her other cut this cd is straight 90 's music but it is aaliyah and it is still a classic favs street thing im so into you no one know old school along with her single 

on aaliyah 's debut it ai n't hard to tell that r kelly found her most of the song sound like aaliyah is featured on them instead of them being her own song like quot back and forth quot and quot old school quot r kelly 's name is even being mentioned in the latter 's chorus one of the only moment that you can feel aaliyah 's ability is on the remake of the isley brothers' quot at your best quot this album is still good to play in your stereo but if you want a really good aaliyah album check out one in a million yeah i know she ha another album after that i meant what i said 

aaliyah the name of the woman who gave birth to every teen sensation out since her debut this includes mya monica christina aguilera britney spear 3lw 702 etc she made it tight to sign a teen to a record deal with 49 minute of sheer genius of r kelly production and songwriting no they were never engaged catapult this from mediocrity to being a cd for the age this beautiful girl with the beatiful voice knock folk on they heel with back and forth then she went for the knockout punch with at your best and the title track all the song are brilliantly done and sung production is timeless another opus is street thing do not sleep on thsi joint anymore cream will always rise to the top dont get it twisted about aaliyah i bet some people think she a new artist which is pretty ridiculous the mother will return witha album this summer drop on july 17th she teased u with romeo must die soundtrack but it is now time to restore order in her household of little quot teenyboppers quot if you consider ya self a true r amp b fan then you should already have this cd if you dont you should be at the store in the next 15 minute u will not be disappointed 

aaliyah 's debut feature a pleasant mix of r b hip hop pop that appealed to a wide audience what also helped fuel interest in her wa the fact that she refused to reveal her age and had some mysterious way about her during interview i know it piqued my interest enough at that time such that i 'd try to watch all of her interview to see if she wa really only 14 or 15 year old or if she wa actually in her 20 i loved the fact that there wa no negative rivalry mess started up between aaliyah brandy since they were both bringing individual flair to the r b field it wa cute how people called brandy a young whitney houston while aaliyah wa being touted a a younger janet jackson this is an interesting album featuring production from then up coming r kelly where he utilizes hard hip hop beat in contrast to aaliyah 's sweet airy vocal the standout track to me are back forth age ain't nothing but a number at your best you are love i'm so into you street thing no one know how to love me quite like you do although a little monotonous i still love the beat i 'd recommend it to aaliyah fan and to those who are curious about mid 90 r b 

i'm a 31 year old white guy that normally listens to metal and grunge but i love this album i had a roommate in the airforce back in 1994 who played this alot and i just came to really like it it 's a good mix of song some smooth r amp b stuff and some more upbeat hip hop type song quot back and forth quot wa the big song off this but quot age ai n't nothing but a number quot quot i'm so into you quot and quot at your best you are love quot are all great a well my favorite though is quot young nation quot it 's just super sweet i do n't know her other album at all and i do n't know the genre well but i do know this disc will make you quot throw your hand up quot 

this is a really great album it sound really cool like early ninety summertime you know that kind of sound and it ha some of my all time favorite aaliyah song like back and forth at your best down young nation age aint nothin but a number no one know and my absolute favorite aaliyah song street thing 

with production by r kelly you had the making of a great album and aaliyah delivered in many way tune were right and her voice still had not developed the full capability being only a 13 y o but well done 

this release wa the young and talented aaliyah 's debut on blackground and jive which wa the first label on which she would release her music her voice ha startling maturity for her youth on this album a she pull off excellent party tune like her first single quot back amp forth quot the energetic quot down with the clique quot and the funky quot throw your hand up quot slow jam are also present the best being her cover of quot at your best you are love quot other top track include the quot mr lee amp r kelly 's remix quot of her afformentioned first single the slow burning quot young nation quot and my personal favorite of this collection the title track quot age ai n't nothing but a number quot this song is so very catchy and nearly instantly you can sing along to it and being doing so day after just that single listen truly a great debut album for a great talent i will miss the music she could have done before her loss this past year but i will always enjoy her shining debut 

i'm amazed this album doe n't have that many 5 star review considering the beat are catchy and ha that typical90s sound i agree that one and a million is her strongest album but it would be hard for me to give age ai n'tnothing but a number le than 5 star yes the lyric can be fluffy at time but i still feel like it doe n'ttake off the focus of the song i 've been listening to it alot these day the song are just hard to resist mostof them made my body rocked to the hook it made me miss the 90 and how much fun it used to be i think r kellywas trying his best to make aaliyah more marketable to the public throughout the song there are frequentshoutouts to her name 1 throw your hand up 5 5 when i listen to this song it give me energy i love the chorus or the bridge ithink having the guest artist rapping throughout the song gave this song more funk 2 back forth 5 5 a song that is about chilling with your friend on a friday night r kelly 's voice add anice touch to it 3 age ai n't nothing but a number 5 5 amazing i would give anything for r'n'b music to sound like this rightnow her smooth vocal go so well with the hardcore gansta hip hop it just make the song more mysterious 4 down with the clique 4 5 5 i do n't think aaliyah sounded all that good especially with the occasional ooos it make her sound like she ca n't sing but the song itself is very laidback and the lyric flow well together 5 at best you are love 5 5 best ballad on the album it suit her voice very well 6 no one know how to love me quite like you do 5 5 the beat reminds me of janet 's you want this great song todance to 7 i'm so into you 5 5 typical fluffly love song but it sound really nice 8 street thing 5 5 i could hear the r kelly influence in her voice she display alot more soul in this songthan the others and it 's the only song where she showcase her upper range in which she did not do very often this is the side of her i enjoy seeing 9 young nation 5 5 it ha that same smooth laidback like age ai n't nothing but a number her vocal sound verysensual and very sexy especially with r kelly 's 10 old school 5 5 i thought it wa kinda boring at first but it grew on me 11 i'm down 5 5 everytime i listen to this it take me back to the mid 90 and those saturday afternoonswatching soul train i love the lil piano playing in the background 12 back forth remix 4 5 cool remix but i prefer the m mello remix i wish they had included that remixinstead of mr lee 's one i think it would have flow well with the smooth and laidback vibe of this album average rating 4 75 

sad and weird it is but the fact is that i had n't bothered listening to aaliyah before all i knew wa that she had starred in quot romeo must die quot alongside jet li now i found out this morning she had been killed in a plane crash yesterday in the bahamas so i figured let me see who this girl really wa and i saw myself listening to her music to be gladly surprised that she 's not the common type of r amp b act at all she died at 22 so that make this 1994 album a remarkable feature having recorded it age 14 if you listen to the sample track above you 'll be a amazed a i continue to be i know her music will live in the heart of all her fan and will continue to gain the respect she well deserved the biggest irony of all is that barely a month ago her new album had hit the store one which the majority of the public reviewer here in amazon have termed 'more mature' and 'eclectic' r i p aaliyah 

yo this wa hyped when it came out i wa a shortie to but it wa all good i still knew the word and had this album when it dropped but yo i love this cd to def foreal but we miss and love ya babygirl forever 

your fan will rejoice in your music and spirit forevermore i still ca n't believe how young aaliyah wa when she recorded this cd her angelic voice glide effortlessly over driving hip hop and r amp b beat 'back amp forth' and the title track 'age' are great example of her vocal ability aaliyah with the help of r kelly remake the isley bro 's classic 'at your best' her version is simply outstanding great job aaliyah you will never be forgotten 

this cd wa aaliyah 's debut cd and it wa very nice r kelly obviously had alot to do with this project since he can be heard all over it aaliyah had a sweet and melodic voice and i had n't heard this cd in year some of my favorite song are back forth at your best i'm so into you old school and i'm down if you are an aaliyah fan get this asap 

aaliyah is not much of a singer but she ha a style about her in her delievery that make her credible i really liked back amp fourth r kelly dominates all thru this disc she ha a certain it about her that brandy monica myia etcc do n't 

i bought this album when it first came out i liked all of the single quot back and forth quot quot at your best you are love quot both the original and remix and quot age ai n't nothing but a number quot but after i listened to the whole album i immediately fell in love with quot street thing quot some of my other favorite song are quot noone know how to love me quite like you do quot and quot i'm down quot 

i took out her 2 cd that i own when i heard of her passing so young and due to the 2 cd that i have along with her other non album single she wa definitely going somewhere and had wonderful talent ahead to show i think you 'll definitely have to like r amp b very soft hip hop in order to appreciate the album also keep in mind that she wa 15 when she did this album some of the 'young me' favorite on the cd are quite a few off the album quot age ai n't nothing but a number quot quot down with the clique quot fun beat amp rhythm quot at your best you are love quot r amp b love song pleasant quot no one know how to love me quite like you do quot more of a hip hop love song unique quot young nation quot and i like the r kelly remix of quot back amp forth quot party song all in all a pleasant album and i would rate this a 4 even before her death wonderful debut album from a 15 year old and the song are what a 15 year old would sing and create along with her co creator 

aaliyah dana haughton is one of our world 's finest entertainer aaliyah posse a golden voice her vocal range is very wide she can hit the high and low note with effortless ease and pristine perfection quot age ai n't nothing but a number quot is a wonderful album aaliyah ha the unique ability to sing to the listener her music touch my very essence this thirteen track album is loaded with hit every track is a perfect ten aaliyah is kind enough to share her fantastic artistic ability with the world i thank aaliyah for that i guarantee that you will love this album do n't think twice buy this album peace from barbados 

long before britney spear asked to be hit one more time christina aguilera wa a genie trapped in a bottle and rihanna offered her umbrella ella ella there wa brandy monica and aaliyah brandy wa the cute girl with braid begging to be dubbed down by a crush and monica wa the too big for her britches miss thang apologizing to her man for trippin' cuz it 's just one of dem day aaliyah wa cool and mysterious with dark shade and baggy clothes the detroit native wa discovered by mr bump'n'grind himself r kelly the result are pretty good to meh and a bit creepy but it wa only the beginning back and forth wa the song that put aaliyah on the map with it 's summery vibe that made you wanna throw your hand in the air and wave 'em round like ya just do n't care the sloppy remix tacked at the end is pointless the title track is one of the best slow jam out there but it 's creepy when you take a look at the lyric age ai n't nothing but a number throwin' down ai n't nothing but a thing this lovin' i have for you it 'll never change anybody remember when aaliyah and r kelly got married when she wa 15 and he wa 27 yeah the short intro of her writing in her diary doe n't help either aaliyah 's cover of at your best you are love is the softest song on the set and showcase the ethereal beauty of her voice she did n't have the widest range but the angelic pureness of her vocal were her strength the gangsta child remix would 've been a better choice for the last track over the back and forth mix other highlight are the ballad street thing i'm so into you no one know how to love me quite like you do although r kelly 's liyah you 're the only one for me is all kind of wrong i'm down and the jazzy cool young nation down with the clique is ok but nearly ruined by r kelly 's silly mumbling about it being the 90 i do n't know what he wa babbling about speaking of which old school turn into a song all about him and how he broke into the business last time i checked this wa aaliyah 's cd yeah he 's hovering in the background like a weirdo stalker on the cover but still i also could 've done without the annoying rap from tia hawkins whoever that is this album ha some pretty good track but aaliyah would come into her own on her next project the missy elliott and timbaland assisted one in a million the le creepiness from r kelly the better 

the soulful sexy attractive elegant beautiful talented aaliyah ha started it all with this album although this cd is almost 10 year old it is still in my cd player non stop my all time favorite track is at your best 06 it is the most soulful track she ha ever done others include age ai n't nothing but a number 04 back forth 03 and i'm down 12 all the other track are incredible a well these are the song i play the most i love her style and her whole everything the track are smooth with her singing and then ha a hip hop flavor to it i love it when an artist know what sell and stick with it this cd sound like it took time to do the song selection on here are just amazing i love her this is what you call real music not that techno synthesized h t that is now called r b this is true and not overplayed if a cd can last for 10 year and not sound out of date then you made a successful album this is one of the four she ha much love these song can be found on the i care 4 u album dvd 

if you 're even a lukewarm fan of brandy monica mya nivea ashanti britney spear mandy moore jessica simpson teirra marie lumidee did i miss any of the clone give this aaliyah debut a good listen all of the aforementioned basically tried to come out behind a very distinctive path carved out by the great aaliyah a true entertainer who combined dance a girl power esque image via assertiveness she called it street but sweet and wa the first to dare to put cool smooth vocal over a blazing hip hop beat aaliyah wa indeed one in a million highly recommended lp 

great work from aaliyah an kelly she wa known for working with the best but this is not flawless like the red album or damn near perfect like one and a million it 's still ha many hit 's like bacc and forth ft r kelly age ai n't nothing but a number down with the clique at your best street thing young nation the best tracc 

aaliyah 's debut cd yielded two top 10 single back and forth and at your best you are love the later or which wa written and originally recorded by the isley brother however the cd is filled with great song including a great balance of hip hip song throw your hand up down with the clique and ballad age ai n't nothing but a number almost any of the song on the cd could have been a hit single that said aaliyah 's voice wa not a mature a it would be later and some of the lyric are a bit juvenile if you 're not down with my clique then you 're poop on a stick the entire cd wa produced by r kelly he appears in the shadow on the cd back cover and is name checked in several song with one producer the cd sound very cohesive but it also is not a varied a her later cd it wa rumored that she and r kelly were married at the time even though she wa only 15 year old her marriage seems to be addressed in the song age ai n't nothing but a number which argues that she is wiser than her year would seem at time the album sound a bit dated the cd one in a million is much better one of the lyric state aalyiah 's got a 90 's swing which is pretty accurate the cd sound very much like an early 90 's hip hp cd despite this complaint i still greatly enjoy this cd it sound great and is a lasting tribute to aaliyah 's talent we will miss out on hearing future recording from this superstar but will continue to enjoy the music she left behind 

with the anniversary of her death approaching now seems like an appropriate time to look back on this promising debut while it ha a fair amount of filler and the hit tune are good but not great age ai n't showed great promise and still entertains on many level for every half baked song sketch with bad rapping throw ya' hand up old school there 's a moment of sheer inspiration and joy back forth and a title track that still bump after 8 year she wa taken from u far too soon but listening to this first effort reminds u of why we fell in love with her in the first place 

this is a really good debut album and it ha that funky 90 hip hop swing sound that i absolutely love this is what real hip hop is about not that garbage that 's on radio and tv nowadays my favorite song on the album is throw your hand up it 's the best song with the best hook that 'll stick in your head for day and you ca n't help but bob your head and rap to it it 's kind of like an anthem to aaliyah and similar artist at the time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 aaliyah 's in the house so if you down with the funky flava throw your hand up and if you got the flavor for aaliyah throw your hand up and if you down with blackground throw your hand up the sassy female rapping voice you hear throughout the album on her song is tia fyi but for some reason she wa n't credited in the album flap this album sound quite different from her subsequent one because she wa teamed with r kelly and tia instead of timbaland and missy misendeamor elliot the single are back and forth an excellent song and a cover of at your best you are love this one put me to sleep but it 's pretty the title track ha a sweet catchy hook and a message i can relate to 

g funk from the bay e fizze rep that bay life the beat are bangin the lyric are dope they slam on my jbl 's makin head turn 

being e 40 's first true lp to be released this album 's quality amazes me even today every one of the 11 song is worth listening to and there are very few slow part on the album this disc is very underground and street sounding considering it wa released so early in e 40 's career when he wa still sellin' tape out of his trunk but after this cd wa released the north bay area rap scene changed greatly and new respect wa given to the area the disc start off with an instant classic track drought season this song talk about exactly what the title say the lack of 'substances' going around in the area do n't need to explain more than that following this track is rat head a pretty good cut about snitch in the game true word spoken on this track skipping a couple good track we come to two of my favorite on the album hide n seek and let him have it earl injects a whole lot of story telling into his rap and both are like a street book on tape both of the beat are insanely well produced and hit your sub with madness the second half of the cd is just a good a the first near the end of the disc we have carlos rossi which is possibly the best song on the album featuring the click e 40 's group from vallejo and a tight beat nuttin' as nigga is a dis towards mac dre and although the beef ha been settled these day back then thing were n't a calm a great song even if it is towards another one of my favorite rapper overall this disc is a street classic and anyone who enjoys bay area rap should not be without it while not quite a classic a his later album in a major way and tha hall of game federal paved the way for future hit nothing le than an a overall score 92 100 

this is a dope album by a very young and under rated e 40 i brought this in 97 and took a chance buying it because i never heard it im a big e 40 fan and i have of his other cd but this one got by me the song federal is super tight that will break your speaker this cd is great but not a good a the mail man which came after this but this is a must ha if your a e 40 fan cause it ha great those old cali mob style beat 

this cd elevated the whole rap game to another level from the independent hustle lingo word and topic this certified 40 to legendary status every song on here bump no skipping my favorite on here are hide n seek ratheads tanji let em have it xtra manish and drought season drought season if you dont have go get it look for the original pressing with the 14 song smg release 

this is one of the all time sickest album ever but why is this not the original where is tanji 2 why do so many older album either leave song off or put additional song on them that were n't there before i am trying to replace all of the album i had when tape were popular with cd 's and this keep happening anyone know where i can find the original e 40 federal 

a lot of you think this is there first national record to rise to stardom but in actualality n2deep back to the hotel put e 40 and b legit to the gold record artist status that they were bound to achieve this record did n't achieve that status but more than should 've if your someone who is a pure click fan the song v town on back to the hotel is one to get when this record wa first released independently sample were n't cleared and when jive picked it up they chose not to clear them and took them of the record bad decision they have sold around 400 000 copy of this yet this a bay classic it still will most likely go gold but it would make it there faster if they would bring back the original album these 4 artist have tried to hold down the westcoast while the rest of the west ha been and stayed on vacation if you do n't have this record get it but if possible hit a store that ha the original copy not the edited version 

i wa introduced to e 40 and the click with mr flamboyant and 40 's flow wa so tight i had to get it though it 's not the original copy release from 1991 1992 down dirty is still tight sick wid' it record wa the first independent rap label to get at least a million advance studio ton did a mojority of this release that wa quickly picked up and imitated by southern producer mic check is a good display of the talent of the fast slang filled rhyme of the crew the original funk on on a mission about retaliation on another click having game being told instead of a hook i'm sideways doing about a buck fifty took another exit to another part of the city how 40 water started on let 's get drunk the hillside of vallejo california family that started a lot of the slang that we now say and need their due recognition on this dirty release 

the original version of this album is one of the best f in album out tha bay definetly forget getting the re release it missing 1 2 the album song skit different beat sample 

the original release of down dirty with 18 track is definitely one of the best album ever made it 's a versatile gangsta rap album that touch a lot of different topic the beat are ahead of their time the big name studio ton mike mosley and sam bostic take care of that e 40 is at his best on this album his unique style and delivery with great lyric combined b legit is also on fire here and even d shot come very hard suga t is only featured on one track on sohabs even though the whole album is classic the best song are let 's get drunk on a mission mr flamboyant daily routine you f ed up when you slammed my motha and of course let 's side the re release on jive with changed beat and narrowed tracklist ai n't anything after you 've heard the original and guess what i have the original tape on great condition for sale holla at me my e mail address is ailuv suomi24 fi 

i heard this when i wa 12 and loved it it ha tight beat and will have you nodding your head it ha that funky sick wit it style all over this one i noticed the beat are different though that is the only bad point this is a rerelease so it get 4 star 

this album is the click 's first album that went out nationwide after being an underground hit in the bay area quot down and durty quot present for the first time v town 's e40 b legit and d shot together with their supporing crew which includes lttle bruice kaveo mugzi levitti and more after hustlin' many year tryin' to make it in their hometown sellin' the tape from their car like many great people in the hip hop industry did too short eazy e performing everywhere in their area they signed with jive and their way up began e 40 his brother d shot their couisin b legit and their sister suga t who 's not on this album came out with a perfect album every single track on it is bangin' tight production by studio ton and mike mosley persents the special sound of sic wit it the record label e40 and b legit founded a bangin' album with smooth and funky music with some of the bay area 's greatest rapper true lyric about street life over some dope music a real classic so it 's a must buy not only for people who like the bay area flava but also people who wanna hear some real dope mobbin' sh t 

first time i 've ever heard of e 40 b legit suga t and d shot i thought they would have been memory by now boy wa i wrong still they came up in the game e40 had the most underground sucess and still he 's very underrated still if you feeling these mug buy this badboy 

the vallejo ca sound wa started in my memory by the click they combine tale of slangin' rock with beat that sound like cutie pie or computer love it is straight west coast but even eastern rebel can groove to cut like bumble hillside and it all bad this is something different because 40 ha a way with the english language that ha never been done before this hiphop is lacking innovator and e 40 is the definition of the word love him or hate on him 

e 40 wa a long time veteran in the rap game when his seminal album in a major way wa released in 1995 it 's really the album that got e 40 noticed by a mainstream audience and pushed jive to ultimately stuff more money into his forthcoming album the next being hall of game 1996 this album ride the line between independent and mainstream line ridiculously well a far a rapping go e 40 is at the very top of his game boasting his slang filled flow with a cunning wit that is arguably in peak form most notably some of the best west coast rapper came to support forty 's untouchable style 2pac mac mall spice 1 who all perform flawlessly on the classic posse track dusted 'n' disgusted da bumble kick off the album right after a solid intro from this point on we catch a glimpse of what the production will sound like throughout although minimal it bang nicely the production is mainly kept in house and is handled by mike mosley studio ton funk daddy among others there are some stellar track here sideways featuring the click 's b legit mac shawn is probably my favorite the beat is tight and is one of my favorite appearance from b legit spittin' is also one of my favorite the album 's front half burn brightly with banger like these it almost feel front loaded with the good but truly boast quality through and through then come perhaps e 40 's greatest single sprinkle me the click 's suga t performs immaculately alongside forty water the beat is tight and the lyric are true to form other standouts are the aforementioned dusted 'n' disgusted and the breakthrough single 1 luv the quality of album track in the mix leaf the album free of filler consistent quality ha always been part of e 40 's repertoire consistently enjoyable full album are another thing in a major way is definitely his most consistent effort to date although the beat maker will prove to hit harder on later album there ha never been a set of beat collaborator that e 40 ha worked better with this is one of the album that defines the bay area in the rap world 

the third solo release in a major way from the self proclaimed ambassator of the bay delivers a complete project with mainstream success e 40 speaks over intro a he give the ingredient contained in this album that tie with da bumble both produced by sam bostic mike mosley with speed variences the objective is definately arranged for the trunk a 40 water flow without any hook chorus or break but his original multi styled flow with charisma and energy a quoted he say she say b tch that away sideways featuring b legit mac shon is for the rider hitting the strip or the block a e and b share verse highlighted by the catchy hook big timer timer 40 water sprinkle me featuring suga t had all the perfect element with a memerable hook perfect delivery and production make this a highlight with a mainstream feel taking it to the street with all star support from 2pac mac mall spice 1 on dusted 'n' disgusted a each shined with their signature flow performed a a letter to a friend in jail 1 luv featuring leviti pose the reality of simply living and e 40 did not miss a beat relating to getting high and getting drunk for serious smoker and drinker smoke 'n' drank wa written with just that in mind dey ai n't no is dark with an incessant deep bass enriched by a piano silhouette to give this lp a more street feel speaking about the street game e 40 spit on how to invest into business for a legal hustle on fed featuring suga t sharing verse with b legit celly cel representing the h i double l side of vallejo california on how they live it 's all bad is about life in the ghetto and changing time comparing it to excerpt found in the bible this song wa enlighened at the conclusion with a surprise guest by e 40 's son with a solid performance the outro only left the listener craving another dosage of this sixteen track album 

1995 wa the bay area 's biggest year artist such a the luniz mac mall and the hieroglyphic were having big hit that year too short just dropped a near classic album and the click wa on point reppin' northern cali area 40 water come out with his third solo album in a major way back in'95 the album ha that northern west coast vibe that is guaranteed to get listener moving a few standouts include ridin' sidewayz with b legit and mac shon spittin' ha a dope bass line too that will hype you up sprinkle me is the album 's first single that feature 40 's younger sister suga t she also sings the hook for fed bay area artist spice 1 mac mall and tupac drop in for the dope dusted 'n' disgusted smoke 'n' drank is my favorite from the album that will keep you bouncing that pre hyphy style song 40 's younger son come in and drop a few bar on all bad to help close out the album e 40 dropped an excellent album for '95 in a major way is mostly consistent all though out a it helped represented the west coast this album vibe like most album out there and it is highly recommended if you 're a fan of their music 4 star highly recommended peace lyric b production a guest appearance b musical vibe a top 5 track 1 smoke 'n' drank2 spittin'3 ridin' sidewayz featuring b legit and mac shon 4 sprinkle me featuring suga t 5 dusted 'n' disgusted featuring spice 1 mac mall and tupac 

i hate e 40 but the track with 2 pac is good the 2 star are only for that song don't buy this junk trust me 

this album iz dope dope dope from start 2 finish no doubt fierce flowz clean a beatz that stomp hella hard standout track r sidewayz feat b legit dusted disgusted feat mac mall spice 1 2pac r i p but th album is sic ta bump all tha way thru also peep all of e 40 b legit the click's album cuz they all sic wid it 

on my opinion this is his best album it 's just damn good his unique style mixed with the funky and fat westcoast beat make this album a classic it 's not right that he did n't sell the unit he deserved to it 's not right that for example ja rule or nelly who do n't have no talent or are n't real make the money that doe n't belong to them maybe e 's flow is just too fast for the big audience 

i had to write this i am a huge e 40 fan since 1993 after listening to all his cd this is the best it his best beat and most creavtive lyric and style on this cd i love the song sprinkle me dusted and disgusted with 2pac and one love he made video for all of those this came out in 96 and he wa just starting to make a national name for himself he never matched this masterpeice he still never really get airplay he deserves but get this cd 

i had this cd back in the day and it broke got me a new one brings back memory lovely cd 

after dropping two underground album e 40 came out with in a major way which is an instant classic e 40 is from vallejo and after dropping this album he proved he had everything it took to be the next west coast rap star his crazy comical hip style is a pleasure to listen to also the beat on this album are some of the best i 've heard in a while they have a richness to them which is real good production come from very accomplished producer like sam bostic and mike mosely studio tone who produced some track for kurupt funk daddy and a few others also e 40 rap extremely fast on some track and it took me a couple listens to get it when i first started listening to him a long time ago however after a listen everything sound clear a a bell he 's also got an amazing guest list tupac suga t mac mall spice 1 b legit mac shawn and celly cel to name a few but most of the track have e 40 going solo which is good too because it 's good to see he 's not just relying on others to guest on his album overall the track sound quot hipper than a hippopotamous quot the album start off with this introduction over a slower beat but then move into the crazy funked out quot the bumble quot e 40 rip this track to shred and the beat is banana definitely one of the most original beat i 've heard in a while quot sideways quot also ha a tight bouncy beat and e 40 and b legit trade line on it with class mac shawn doe the chorus clever lyricism on here too quot spittin' quot ha a heavy sunny funk beat e 40 come with a real nice intro at the beginning but sound nice throughout quot sprinkle me quot is a classic single with a fun sunny beat and suga t e 40 's sister guest on it they make a nice sibling team sprinkle me mayne quot dusted and disgusted quot like everyone else say is a classic posse cut it feature tupac spice 1 and mac mall the way the beat change is so dope e 40 hold his own against three other great emcee part of the beat is a nice laid back one and the other is a rough gangsta beat quot one love quot is a nice light hearted track where 40 get personal great line quot this ai n't no happy shirley temple talleistic crap this here is serious more realistic than radio shack quot actually sound like it could 've been a huge hit even today quot smoke and drink quot ha more of a zapp sound to it e 40 rap really fast on it but nicely and the beat ha this cool groove to it and i love the refrain quot they ai n't know quot is a slower song about street life and gettin' money the lyric are worth listening to quot fed quot ha a great bouncing bass beat and e 40 rip it the tune sound kind of familiar from something else it 's catchy quot h i double l quot is a classic ode to vallejo featuring b legit and celly cel who both tear it up along with 40 the beat is nice and sound like the kind of thing for the car quot bootsee quot is a tight funky track about a busta named quot bootsee quot i'm sure you 're familiar with someone in real life who fake and claim to be tough when they 're really just fakin' it quot it 's all bad quot is a darker track where 40 speaks on various subject in life he know the game well overall if you like bay area rap you probably have this but if you do n't try it e 40 tear it up everytime he 's on the mic on this record and the beat are amazing 

this is easily e 40 's best work quot in a major way quot is top notch material from beginning to end the beat provide classic west coast g funk while 40 's flow and linguistics are solid a usual nearly every track is equal in calibur but the 3 stand out would probably be the classic quot dusted amp disgusted quot quot 1 luv quot and quot spittin quot there 's not one weak track on here if you 're into the west coast sound and even if you 're not this is an album you should definitely have in your collection the west could use another album of this calibur these day 

in a major way is e 40 's best album a bay area classic the vallejo bos playa just blew up on this amazing album feature the unmatchable beat by mike mosley amp sam bostic funk daddy and studio ton the album is perfect from start to end and it 's got the two classic cut sprinkle me feat suga t and the one and only dusted 'n' disgusted which ha one of the tightest beat i 've ever heard combined with breathtaking verse by the greatest rapper spice 1 2pac mac mall and 40 water the album also feature 40 's long time partner b legit and also mac shawn levitti and celly cel this album take the sick wid it mob sound to a whole new level and e 40 continues to develop his own unique style inventing new slang and always comming with fresh delivery 

umm what shall i say 'bout this one it 's pretty easy if you like westcoast rap you gon' love this one e 40 's best all around and probarly one of bay area 's finest up there together with mac mall 's illegal business e 40 never dissapoints me and after dropping so many album he still ha n't got the prop he deserves the whole bay area is painfully underated mac mall spice 1 e 40 and his sick wid it record click and ray luv these are my favorite outta bay area buy anything by them and show love 'cause it basically do n't get pretty much better than this type of westcoast rap one word for this record classic i do n't even have to mention highlight 'cause they 're all great but my favorite probarly is dusten 'n' disgusted featuring 2pac spice 1 and mac mall get this one it will make you money worth no doubt 

man this is cd is fire man fo reel this is his best work in my opinion u can pop this in and play it thru e fo day drop heat on this one id give it 10 star if i could go buy this now goddammit the best song are all of 'em 

e 40 is at his best on this album he may rap about hustlin sex and violence like many of his peer but the way he doe it is inventive he created much of the slang we use today this album is laced with hard mobb beat dusted and disgusted melodic g funk laden with whiny keyboard riff drank and smoke and even a track with a beat hinting of what we call today crunk 1 luv he paired these neat beat with with his tongue twisting flow most of the song on the album are classic the one that are n't are still tight bump this funky materpiece from the yay while sittin' sideways in a lac 

this is 40 water second best just behind element of intro that 's one of the best intro 's i ever heard spittin' sprinkle me i ca n't celieve vibe did not add this classic tracc on there 50 greatest duet of all time smh dusted 'n' disgusted 1luv is crazy bootsee h i double l dey ai n't no smoke drank sideways the bumble it 's all bad ft his lil son 

e 40 forty water whatever you want to call him is a bit of an aquired taste even though i heard his music year ago it took me until this year to finally check out 1 of his album i first heard him on aint hard to find off 2pac 's all eyez on me and i wa thinking who the f ck is this guy his goofy voice and rapid fire flow took me quite a while to get used to but after bumping dusted disgusted for a long time i decided to pick up in a major way i had to order this from amazon a there are literally no copy of this album in england you just ca n't get hold of stuff like this and i wa surprised by how great it wa e 40 ha long been known a an innovator something hiphop is sorely lacking both in term of his unique flow and his vast slang vocabulary which so many others have bitten over the year this album according to most people is when he wa at his peak in both though i ca n't comment a this is the only album of his i own i do intend to buy more though my favourite track is still dusted disgusted ft spice 1 2pac mac mall which is a westcoast classic but other classic include 1 luv and the amazing smoke n drank pretty much every other track is tight the only reason i do n't quite give it 5 star is because of a couple of filler track dey aint no bootsee which is terrible production is top notch throughout some classic westcoast beat that really bump recommended to any hiphop fan especially westcoast if you can get past his wierd voice flow you will see that some of his lyric are actually pretty clever he rap about the same thing most westcoast rapper do but he doe it creatively if you ca n't follow him just get a lyric sheet and listen up very good album 4 5 star another case for half star at amazon 

slipped lipped body snatchin' thugroovalishus playa for playa and ego trippy e 40 's ha been my favorite rapper since he and the click came quot down 'n dirty quot in the 90 's i like this one the best because my favorite quot fed quot is on it but anyone of e dollah dawg 's cut are good from any of his or the click 's cd 

great clazzik s t e 40 forty water iz killin em all in the rap world i love this whole disc a must buy for any serious rap head 

every song on this album is solid a close to no flaw a possible for any record i have been a fan for year and it good to see that there all still shinin a a group and a solo artist it would also be tight to see a new record from b legit suga t the mossie levitti and the rest of valley joe giant if you like westcoast rap then you gotta have this to be a rap fan and thats real 

critic trashed this album when it came out too polished overproduced not like down and dirty blah blah blah this is a great album that showcase their growth and success everybody really doe a good job on this album this second album ha more great song than their third album quot money and muscle and better performance and more mature than down and dirty definite satisfaction take the down and dirty album and add about million dollar worth of production value and you get this album the group probably wo n't make a fourth album so this is the one everyone will remember 

the click have been under rated and overlooked for year and probably always will be despite that they 've managed to put out better sh than 90 of rapper out there game related is a must have for any west coast fan and any rap fan in general should at least check it out my personal fav track are hurricane out my body we do n't f ck wit dat scandalous learn about it peace 

i love there first album is i had to get this one this is just a good a that one the music ha more quality to it the underground sound is kinda missing but it still good bos baller is good actin bad and hurricane are stand out track this should have done better cause it ha that commercial quality bet or mtv didnt play rap they do now in 1996 but yeah get the album

from the instant this album start with prop to kr from just about every old school rapper dj or figure you can think of you know that this is going to be an album with distinct nod to the past when you see who feature on some of these track fat joe channel live da efx and mad lion you know that the album 's going to look forward to the future kr is one of hip hop 's elder statesman having made his mark a frontman for boogie down production quot the bridge is over quot with this album he register two solo album a well a a result of his experience he know what he 's talking about when he claim quot rapper r n dainja quot or quot mc act like they do n't know quot he mean it another feature of his vintage is that he come from a time when mc lived and died by the lyric they recited not by the catchiness of a hook or funk of a beat thus he is able to preach his sociological message while still making superb rhyme if anyone doubt his sociological qualification he ha done many lecture tour and quot wrote over 1000 rhyme hook and sociological book while you were worrying about your look quot one slight downside to kr one 's style is that the abrasive nature of his voice can sometimes get irritating it 's a good thing then that he ha brought in rapper with distinctive style and voice to balance his this practice doe have it downside though quot de automatic quot is one of the stronger track on the album but the outro ha the only appearance of fat joe repeating the word quot the south bronx the south south bronx quot which seems to interrupt the flow a bit the same is slightly le true for quot wannabemcees quot where mad lion 's distinctive toasting style only turn up in the outro at least it is more grabbing than fat joe 's rap the best track on the album would probably be quot wannabemcees quot quot de automatic quot and quot hold quot in which kr tell a story with one of the most amazing rhyme scheme ever recorded honorable mention would go to quot mc act like they do n't know quot where over a dj premier beat kr doe a version of kurtis blow 's intro to quot the break quot quot clap your hand everybody if you 've got what it take coz i'm kr and i'm on the mike and premier 's on the break quot a opposed to quot clap your hand everybody if you 've got what it take coz i'm kurtis blow and i want you to know that these are the break quot on the whole kr one delivers another sterling performance highlighted by amazing use of the mike and a great instinct to give the people what they want straight up with a twist 

this is the teacher 's self titled album contains more lesson and upliftment for african american dj premier 's production on rappaz r n dainja and mc 's act like they do n't know wa are great east coast hip hop feel displaying krs' lyricisim ah yeah display his consciousness of scociety 's problem a automatic a his flow on de automatic featuring fat joe stack some money for a video i do n't have any you 're looking at the last emcee with true talent he put it into perspective with build ya skillz this release is a presentation of plain hip hop nothing commercial just r e a l i t y through the eye of bronx own kr one 

hip hop v rap wa the origonal name of this album before kr one self titled his '95 album this is one of those album that show why the east coast had dominated this rap game in the mid 90 's even though during that year the west coast peaked with such banging album not to mention being in the game for such a long time kris wa one of those emcee with his socially concious lyric who wa ahead of his time and would reach his peak with this album here no matter what way or how he doe it he get the job done talking about how the fake emcee are making album and he 's ready to get them on rappaz r n danja an idea carried over from the song outta here from his previous albumreturn of the boom bap he ha major energy on dope track like ah yeah and r e a l i t y and there are track that explains why he is the teacha of hip hop on the song that question religion the truth even the guest bring their a game a well such a da efx on reperesent the real hip hop and channel live on free mumia kris i hope you 're not defending the slave record company other guest like busta rhyme and fat joe do ad libs on the song that they appear on all throughout the album there are a few drop and shoutouts from artist and dj 's from different radio station even the production will keep you intuned dj premier fly in the dope headbanger mc 's act like they know and wannabeemceez showbiz and diamond d a well a others brings in come dope beat for this album here kris' self titled album is great like i said each song here show why he is one of the best in the game somehow he still manages to get his point across with his dope rhyme not to mentioned backed by some great producer if you have n't heard any other solo album also check outreturn of the boom bapas another hot album by kris caution do n't sleep peace lyric a production aguest appearance amusical vibe atop 5 track 1 mc 's act like they know2 free mumia featuring channel live 3 represent the real hip hop featruing da efx 4 the truth5 ah yeahhonorable mention 1 hold2 r e a l i t y 

for his second solo album kr one worked with a variety of younger hip hop talent perhaps in an attempt to resuscitate his street credibility and his commercial standing featuring appearance by da efx mad lion fat joe and channel live kr one is loaded with fresh talent of the first rank and they help spark the teacher into giving an inspired performance the album also showcase a bit fuller production than return of the boom bap but that doe n't mean he ha sold it out it just mean he 's continuing to experiment which is one of the reason kr one remained a vital artist nearly a decade after his first record 

the general opinion of this album seems to be that this is the best kr ha done so far i would have to agree 100 the beat and rhyme have not been repeated by himself before or after this no matter how hard he may have tried lyric wise krs1 ha always come correct rhyming with clarity purity intelligence and skill beat wise he 's not that bad either and on this album he 's better than that dj premier produce 3 of the best song ive ever heard kr do with rappaz r n dainja mc 's act like they do n't know and wannabemceez the beat are simply soul shaking to put it mildly the rhyme are delivered with real drive on virtually all the joint apart from the more laid back one like ah yeah which i wasnt really feeling hold masterful wordplay squash all beef and health wealth self simply uplifting i think track like r e a l i t y free mumia the truth build ya skillz and out for fame are all amazing and only strengthen the album even more outstanding from start to finish apart from ah yeah and de automatic it perfect 

kr one self titled released in the fall of 1995 kr one 's self titled lp technically his second solo effort hit store at a time when hip hop wa still dominated by the east west rivalry of faction like death row record and bad boy record the 80 's era old school were waning from public view a the then current rap star were taking the spotlight not just with their record but with their run in with the law by the mid 90 's it wa n't hip to be a `teacher' so much a it wa to be a thug or gangsta a vocal critic of the widespread trend of the video superstar on mc 's act like they do n't know kr confronts this dilemma you could be a mack a pimp hustler or player but make sure live you are a dope rhyme sayer in other word whatever your `role' is in rap be sure to be an engaging performer ah yeah is a militant tribute to the black panther squash all beef warns people to avoid the fatal consequence of holding grudge represent the real hip hop team the artist with da efx other artist providing cameo either on or in between recording include fat joe busta rhyme and even mc hammer the production is largely handled by dj premier showbiz and diamond d along with the artist a re release of this album should include some of the remixes done including the rare rappaz r n dainja chain me to the gear remix by audioslave 's tom morello 

ha ha those were the day kr one is the greatest battle mc of all time and if you listen to hiphop mainstream or underground and dont own one of his album then you need to get with the program hop because whoever your favorite mc is whether it be beanie seagall jay z na talib kweli capitol d c rayz walz mo def or akrobatic these mc and thousand of other were directly influenced by kr one rhyme style if that doesnt make him the greatest mc of all time i dont know what doe lyricly kris ha always brought it but this album is a personal favorite on the lyrical tip i consider this to be one of the greatest lyrical album of all time beat are provided by dj premier which is always a plus kris' rhyme style worked really well with preimos production it would be really sweet if they could get back together and produce another album if your looking for a truly dope lyrical and musical album it really doesnt get much better than this 

i have seen kr one on television for a long a i can remember talking about hip hop and rapping in his video also when people speak of some of the best artist hip hop ha ever seen his name is often mentioned i never took the time to listen to him with my undivided attention because i wa so young when his music wa popular i finally listened to his self titled album and wa truly amazed at every aspect there are no weak song on this album here you will find real hip hop real hip hop beat that will have you bobbing your head uncontrollably real hip hop lyric about both positive and negative aspect of life for example in squash all beef kr is telling his listener the virtue in dealing with confrontation without violence this is such a positive message because in hip hop there is a vortex of negative energy rap artist are constantly talking about who they have killed who they want to kill and who they should kill it becomes sickening after awhile to hear kr say squash all beef wa so refreshing that song is very real and positive i commend him for his maturity out for fame and ah yeah are good track too ah yeah is definitely controversial but the lyric are so powerful i highly recommend this album to fan of hip hop rap music i finally see the difference between a hip hop album and a real hip hop album because in essence hip hop ha more than one aspect there ha to be a certain energy in the artist 's voice the beat ha to sound a certain way and the lyric have to hit some in some way kr one passed the real hip hop test with flying color i will definitely be listening to much more of him 4 shining shars mikeisha 's top 51 wannabeemcez 2 mc act like they do n't know 3 wealth health self 4 ah yeah 5 squash all beef 

i am a fan from the bdp day of kr his self titled release here wa a bit slept on at the time i think boom bap wa just so cool and groundbreaking that when this came on people wanted more of that sound now that nearly 10 year have passed this album stand up very well especially with this blinged out era it almost like crawling into a time capsule the hottest joint mc 's act like they do n't know could put any rhyme out there today on it back by itself thats not even the hardest cut on a emcee basis check out build ya skill with busta rhyme thats some whoop as for ya dj premier probably did some of his finest work on this album kr also blended his production nicely too if you are kr fan this ca n't dissapoint 

how is this not 5 star there is way too many 4 star for this album but besides that mr kr one ha delivered possibly the best hip hop cd of 1995 the single were bangin rappaz r n danja start the album off perfect with premier on the track you ca n't go wrong ah yeah ha a killer drum beat and is one of my favorite from the album mc 's act like they do n't know is the hardest track kr ever did and definitely is premier top produced track free mumia is dope a hell kr produced this himself hold is kr describing a gun and what it mean to hold one classic track the truth a song about religion and who where the first human being on earth which is we all know adam and eve build ya skill a dope track featuring busta rhyme classic feature right here but enough talk go out and buy this album it truly is kr one best solo album post bdp era 

the most blazing cut quot rappaz r n dainja quot also try to find the rare remix by rage against the machine 's tom morello quot ah yeah quot quot squash all beef quot quot represent the real quot with da efx quot out for fame quot give prop to graffiti artist dope production tactic by dj premier diamond d and cameo by fat joe busta rhyme and a who 's who of hip hop personality one of 1995 's best album but still slept on go buy this record 

this is a classic album and it 's kr one 's best it includes the well known hit single mc act like they do n't know but my favorite song wa represent the real hip hop this is a must have album it made '95 one of hip hop 's best year 

kr one 's kr one is one of my favorite album by kr also my favorite cd in my collection because i feel this album is deeper then anything i 've heard in my life im a huge huge fan of kr work and his lirycs and his production is just amazing support kr one he 's the truth 

one thing 's certain if you 're trying to find out why kr is considered by many to be one of the greatest emcee of all time look no further than his self titled 1995 album kr one the blastmaster kick scathing battle rhyme mc act like they do n't know over hardcore boombastic beat rapper r n danja and prof why he is the definition of an emcee by freestyling his verse on the album 's main criticism of fake emcee wannabemceez elsewhere kr explores the frustrated ghetto mind hold encourages black to use compromise over killing squash all beef question orthodox christianity the truth and put a muzzle on rap critic free mumia to understand the overall tone of the album an excerpt from rapper r n danja i remember thinkin' back to '83 no video no you had to be a real live emcee now you youngins grow up buggin any new jock your huggin ' weak production let me tell you somethin any emcee can battle for glory but to kick a dope rhyme to wake up your people 's another story act like you never saw me cauz when it come to lyric i'm in a different category cop this album today and enlighten yourself 

celly cel is a bay area vet who despite an impressive discography never quite received the acclaim of his buddy e 40 and spice 1 his 1995 sophomore effort killa kali is an excellent album of top notch bay area hip hop celly 's not a lyrical visionary but he 's an appealing rapper because he ha style a good flow and delivery and a commanding presence on the mic he rap about what he know and most of the time that consists of life in the bay hustling and violence he delivers good hook and overall make a nice performance what set killa kali apart from the sea of bay area album from the mid 90 is the production the music carry a distinctly bay area sound with the choppy and bass heavy beat and whiny instrumentals but it is more melodic smoother and catchier than most of celly 's brother 's the beat are funky and have a clean polish killa kali is one of those album that is so consistent not much stand out but that 's definitely a good thing you 'll be hard pressed to find any flaw in this well executed lp celly is a likable rapper and the beat are awesome among the best from the left coast in the fine year of '95 guest appearance are strong and unlike some of the weirder stuff that came from the bay during this period it ha a wide appeal and rap fan of all type will enjoy the funky track after the intro celly spit some menacing lyric on the nice what u n z thought and trade off verse with e 40 on the bay area thumper 4 tha scrilla the single it 's goin' down is just an awesome track boasting a perfect laidback g funk beat with woozy electronic element and a great performance from celly profiling a day in the life ca n't tell me s ha some hard hitting production and tha bullet is a surprising concept track with verse coming from the perspective of a gunshot bullet my favorite song is the spice 1 collaboration red rum because the two mc display such great chemistry the production shine on skanlezz azz b z and remember where you came from and the latter is a catchy track that supply one of celly 's better performance the title track is a potent west coast anthem on all front while playerizm is slow rolling the closer funk season is a highlight with celly showing a tight flow over a nice beat killa kali is n't revolutionary by any mean but celly put together a great album with tight beat and good performance this is one of the very best lp to emerge from the bay area explosion in the mid 90 standing tall with the best album from e 40 spice 1 and the young black brotha roster '95 saw so many classic lp that one like this often get overlooked but the track on killa kali have the spirit that made '95 such a great year for hip hop i highly recommend this album to west coast fan 

thiz album iz dope all tha way thru definete clasicc jus like all hiz otherz raw flowz w og delivery super clean beatz dont sleep make sure 2 peep all that other sic wit it record hiyit 

back in early '96 i remember watching the classic video quot it 's goin' down quot on rap city while i wa in college and i said to myself i 've got to go and find this cd and i did a couple of week later this cd from top to bottom is just dope with quot round 2 intro quot k lou doe most of the production on this cd which make this cd an instant g funk classic some of the other track that just brings this cd to the forefront is quot killa kali quot quot skanless a b quot quot funk season quot so go ahead and order your copy if you love g funk 

celly cel 's killa kali is a dope record a lot of hip hop rap fan sleep on dude and i ca n't understand why if you love gangsta rap music and do n't have this you 've been missin out on one of the best album in the genre a 

dope west coast album i 'd heard of it for a long time and finally found it and decided to give it a try and it turn out to be dope definently a night album though most of the beat are slow and real funky it 's definently a west coast album sick 

this album is filled wit some tight lryics and beat celly cel put down some pretty cool hardcore rap in dis album it is worth checking out and if you are a sickwidit record fan then you will like dis one any question you wish to ask me go ahead and ask me at yuckplace hotmail com 

if your looking for a funky as west coast classic look no further this is the only cd of cell 's that i 've heard and take my word for it every single track ha a awesome beat and celly cell tear it up on the mic this cd is a straight up mid 90 west coast classic cop it 

i first heard of celly cel on e 40 's in a major way then a certain music company who i'm not at liberty to say their name had his album for sale so i purchased it and wa pleasantly surprised celly cel can flow and the production team behind him is serious what u n z thought is the hard edged opener a celly cel drop some good rhyme over a hard beat in tha bullet creative concept he talk about being a bullet and all the damage it cause he ha two song with guest appearance 4 tha scrilla featuring e 40 and b legit and redrum featuring spice 1 both of which are standouts he also drop you a gem on remember where you came from a he tell the consequence of what happens when you forget where you came from there is no filler although i dont like the screwed up voice in the hook for funk season bottom line celly cel 's killa kali is his best album and is definetly a highlight underground album for 96 celly cel can be added to the long list of underrated mc from the west coast yukmouth c bo xzibit etc standout track what you n z thought 4 tha scrilla it goin down tha bullet redrum skanlezz azz b z kila kali and funk season 

celly cel really doe his thug thang on this album he throw in his complex loud and often fast flow over tight g funk beat a standout track is what u n z thought the song is laced with some of the hardest beat and rhyme in gangsta rap a menacing foreground beat with a dr dre'ish whiny keyboard synth in the background he sound really angry and crazy on that song it 's goin down is a lot slower it ha a nice slow jam beat with the occasional faint use of a talk box reciting it 's goin down during the hook throughout the album he show the harder side of california life 

after establishing himself a a strong solo presense on12 playthis album really doe distance r kelly from any semblance of new jack swing that remained on his earlier recording much a with mary j 'smy lifethis album is part of a series of recording that swing the genre of hip hop r b into more of a fluid groove that showcase a mixture of modern touch a live instrument a with the sermon on the intro this is an album where r kelly really began to involve himself in the age old soul music tradition of blending the spiritual with the secular consistantly pulling a very al green style lyric tag throughout this album at the drop of a hat by pleading to jesus and pleading for romance all at the same time during this era this come a something of a surprise a often enough the two concept seemed to play out more seperately than together overall from song to song there 's a strong similarity to most of the cut on this album except for some very shallow lyric on you remind me of something this album largely focus it 's attention on on midtempo song with light hip hop beat it worked dynamite in the day and usually aside from occasion where it worked better a a single the song on this album all kind of flow together a one statement some song such a the intricately textured religious love feature an interesting mix of percussion and modern beat wheras trade in my life really bought the pretty full on gospel out of the box completely of course to me the strongest cut on the album are the full blown disco funk arrangement of you to be be happy with notorious b i g and that excellent thank god it 's friday both of which showcase the type of sound that r would begin to explore to a far broader degree and with a huge creative leap ahead in his musical career in the album to come r kelly is still not at the apex of his career with this album there 's still a bit of mildly dated hip hop production here and there but when this album cook it char broil and is an excellent if quickly executed beginning to the second phase of r kelly 's musical career 

r kelly 's self titled third album and second solo release ha everything the others have with more exploring of his boundary and even spirituality a done on intro the sermon heaven if you hear me a i look into my life and trade in my life r take it to a club scene with hump bounce a he state everyday every night humpin' and bouncin' is all i wanna do you remind me of something is a mid tempo tune where he compare a woman to a jeep his sound his car and his bank account she must be something especially nice then the mood change to a bit more sexual atmosphere with the inviting step in my room and he make offer to anything you want on baby baby baby baby baby the classic love or anti love song with 70 feel about creeping on down low nobody ha to know featuring ronald ernie isley he then begs for forgiveness and want his lover to come back with i ca n't sleep baby if i thank god it 's friday ha the same feel of his later hit step in the name of love to the rescue he come in with love is on the way for another mid tempo bass filled song religious love is simple and have feeling of depth undiscovered for a single person a he prays for love he slows the motion to almost still a the light turn down low on tempo slow the sixteen song which were written and produced by r kelly seem never ending and on the other hand it seems too short but it will be kept on repeat 

this cd start off with slow beat and feature b i g and a couple others thats all there is to know my favorite song is probably thank god it 's friday 

with his thrid cd in three year r kelly delivered more of his usual antic while this cd had it 's moment it also had it 's share of weak moment the strong moment were the ballad which he 's always known for the first trio of ballad the hit single you remind me of something baby baby baby baby baby and my personal favorite step in my room show r 's vocal and writing at it 's best the next two strong ballad down low nobody ha to know and i ca n't sleep baby if i were also good although the remixes were better the other strong ballad tempo slow wa placed at towards the end of the cd but it wa placed in the middle of r kelly 's religous section of the cd 

very few album out at the moment are so good that you can listen to it from start to finish although this is far more mellow and laid back than just about all of kelly 's other album the consistant quality of the song make this a treat to the ear kelly ha said that it wa around this time that he discovered god god really must have inspired him a it is far greater than his previous work although 12 play is a classic just about the best ballad kelly ever wrote quot i ca n't sleep baby if i is probably the best song on the album followed closely by the mid tempo quot thank god it 's friday quot the multi octave style of marvin gaye can be seen used here it is a pity kelly doe n't use it anymore if you are just getting into his work and are not going for the more hardcore element of quot best of both world quot get this album a it will really open the door to what ti guy is trying to say 

i cant get enough of this cd all the song are str8 this cd is a musy buy 

this is the album that really made me take notice of tha rrah i gave it a 5 star rating because a a music lover any album that grab my attention allows me to listen all the way through without skipping is classic in my book this album just flow from song to song no production flaw no song that jarred my sensabilities there 's not a bad song on this disc but the standouts to me are you remind me of something classic slow jam for the 90 's you to be happy w notorious b i g great collabodown low who can forget that epic videoi ca n't sleep baby love this song trade in my life a powerful a i believe i can fly 

i thought i 'd never be a r kelly fan till i herd this album1 intro the sermon 4 102 hump bounce 7 5 103 not gonna hold on 10 104 you remind me of something 10 105 step in my room 8 5 106 baby baby baby 6 107 you to be be happy ft the notorious b i g 8 108 down low nobody ha to know ft the isley brother 10 109 i ca n't sleep baby 10 1010 thank god it 's friday 6 1011 love is on the way 6 1012 heaven can you hear me 7 1013 religous love 7 5 1014 tempo slow 7 5 1015 a i look into my life 6 1016 trade in my life 6 10top 5 songs1 down low nobody ha to know 2 i ca n't sleep baby3 not gonna hold on4 you remind me of something5 step in my roomoverall 8 10 

i did n't think r could top 12 play but he did although the begging stuff get kinda worn out only he could do it in so many way and quot trade in my life quot is one of the best gospel song i 've ever heard keep it up 

i like these cd that he ha in amazon we really like his singingand you can to like him 

you could think that this wa his first album based on the eponymous title of it but it wa his third album after born into the 90 's from 1992 together with public announcement althought it sounded like a r kelly affair all the way and then the sexual explicit 12 play from 1993 this album wa released in 1995 and stand a one of his best album to date only 12 play and r can measure with it this is a quite easily accessible album since it doe n't follow any trend or theme no overwhelming sexual lyric nor a overpretentious step album either it got a great mix of the best some faster song but many wonderful tearjerking ballad aswell infact some of the greatest r kelly song are actually found here there is n't much filler either nor any annoying hip hop collaboration like we saw on latter album no r kelly stand strong on it 's own and a a whole this is a fantastic story of trade mark r kelly song that fan would drool over the album start with hump bounce that actually based on it 's name sound like it would have been on 12 play it 's a sexy midtempo with lyric both from a woman and a rapper a very good song not gonna hold you is a semi ballad that also feautures female vocal you reminds me of something stand a one of his best ballad to date song like this made r kelly one of the most promising songwriter of the 90 's step into my room yet another laidback sexy ballad perhaps also better for his previous album baby baby baby baby baby yet another laidback soulish ballad you to be happy is midtempo soul down low is one of my favorite r kelly song it 's a very poignant ballad feauturing ron and ernie isley the great video also which portraited r kelly in the middle of a fatal jelousy drama i ca n't sleep follows the trend of slow jamz while thank god it 's friday is a excellent club song even if it 's slick love is one the way is yet another good midtempo heaven is only a interlude but religious love show some of his more faithful side tempo slow is one of the slower song of this album it 's dreamy and meditative next song called a i look into my life is also more of a interlude but trade my love close this album well another midtempo that is r kelly is one of his best album needle to say it capture you with it 's mix of slick and sexy ballad and midtempo 's and it doe n't contain much filler either if you 're new to r kelly start with this one or 12 play this album is more clean though 5 5 

i listened to this cd and i wa amazed this cd start off fast then at the end it is slow and calm the last song is an inspirational song which sound soooo good pick up this album because it is worth it 

i love r kelly and all his material and i love this album the best out of all i 've heard of his i have almost all of his cd 's but out of all of those and in fact out of all i own i still listen to this cd real often it 's the best i love love love down low ca n't sleep baby and thank god it 's friday they are the best cut on here he 's such a great talent and so underrated he 's soulful and a joy to listen to despite whatever go on in his personal life he remains one of my top favourite singer ever down low is among my top 10 favourite song of all time and i could listen to this cd over and over again never get sick of it 

who can make a cd better than kells this is an oldie but a with all of them it a goodie 

this cd is really good a usual r kelly is really talented writer and producer when it come to music no matter that this cd is ten year old you can still listen to it over and over again the best song on here are you remind me of something step into my room baby baby baby baby and down low which wa a huge megahit when it came out and still is widely known for pinning the popular term to call any relationship that is the quiet hush hush secretive sin of illicit sexual rompings not that this is a good thing because it is really not but the song sound so good i do have to disagree with his message in the sermon where he throw the criticism back in the face of all those who condemn him for this sexual and explicit nature all of that even the statue of liberty want to bump and grind wa uncalled for and unnecessary and it is exactly this reason why he ha gotten into so much trouble with his little scandal and sexual escape though i like his music people are right in their analysis of him because really he is just too sexual and wanton in nature for which he make no apology what he call judgment is really the truth thus the conclusion despite it lax moral and looseness it just a really nice and well produced cd 

this album in my opinion is r 's finest of all sadly 1995 's r kelly seems slept on due to a lack of real hit single which is a damned shame a he never got a deep before or since it is mature beautifully orchestrated and he had now found his own vibe born into the 90 and to a lesser extent 12 play were soaked with the influence of guy 's new jack era material and although both especially the later had great chart friendly appeal this album is his fully realised masterpiece operating within the framework of a gospel themed intro and closure r is on best behaviour and there is little of the shallow thug posturing that on occasion have hurt his recent release like r and tp 2 com there is a chilled bumping flow throughout and this is no better exemplified than on probably my favourite r kelly track of all down low the chemistry between r and ronald isley brother ernie assisting on guitar is beautiful to behold a true epic laid back jam contagious the sequel on isley brothers' eternal album is equally excellent other highlight to be found include you remind me of something with it 's humourous metaphor and you to be be happy which effortlessly work a notorious big rap in there 's the usual quality bedroom ballad step in my room yet he plough a deeper grain with the exquisite i ca n't sleep baby if i hump bounce and thank god it 's friday are prime relaxed head nodders there 's not a weak moment to be found and the lp 's self titled moniker of r kelly surely come from the work here being the ultimate personal statement of his artistic muse despite the relative inconsistency of subsequent effort i'm sure he can sleep well rest assured that in this album he produced a true work of class no matter what the future hold 

i truly dig this album alot more a time pass it just get better with time between this album 12play chocolatefactory loveland r kelly to me ha made 3 of the most important album since 1990 this album combine many element that truly highlight r kelly a a writer producer arranger his vocal truly soar here rocking it with biggie on you to be happy that jam is my cut thank god it 's friday is a knockout jam that truly get me hyped on the weekend dow low nobody ha to now with the great ronald isley is a hall of fame song that still is tight religious love work a well this soulful genius is unstoppable when he allows his musical strength to direct his flow 

r kelly began in that 90 's generation era which wa my coming out so im kinda partial to the r present legal problem excluded he is an excellent song writer and producer he ha got that platinum touch no denying that this cd is one of his best 

before the release of this album i thought the 12 play wa his best but this self titled release blew that album out of the water i love 12 play and it would still get spin till this day but this album got more spin from me than that album this album came out at a time when r b gave you quality artist with tight album so you couldnt go wrong with r kelly back then you could go wrong with him now because he 's trying to hard to remain relevant by making song for teenager like that 's all his fanbase consists of at any rate you remind me of something wa the summer jam and i refuse to let some corny cable channel that nobody watch and some lame ragazine that is the b st rd child of rolling stone magazine tell me different r kelly is at his best when he doe the slow jam like step in my room baby baby baby baby baby religious love and the fantastic i cant sleep i love tempo slow it ha a unique concept where the tempo of the song change after every chorus you would rarely find an artist that creative now and when one doe come around stupid hoity toity critic will knock them for being unconventional the late notorious big make his presence felt in you to be be happy hump bounce and thank god it friday are dynamite party song down low feat the isley brother is the beginning of the mr biggs r kelly saga the album close off with trade in my life there are no bad song to be found on here and that in itself is rare with 2000 r b r kelly 's self titled sophomore release is his best album point blank period it show his range a an artist it show his talent at songwriting and it show that he wa a giant in the game that wa here to stay pick it up if you are interested in what real r b is supposed to sound like standouts you remind me of something step in my room baby baby baby baby baby down low i can't sleep baby religious love tempo slow and trade in my life 

it 's rare that an artist release a record with no title a if to say quot here i am baby this record is so good it doe n't even need a title quot now in r kelly 's case i would say that 's a little overestimation but this is still a very good record my main issue with r kelly is that he ca n't decide what he want to be his song exude vibe of a sex maniac a star crossed lover even a seriously religious devotee and it 's that multiple persona problem that make his album sound like a compilation more than an actual work but be that a it may the collection of song on this album is more than ample kicking off with a baptist style sermon we segue right into the complete opposite end of the spectrum with quot hump bounce quot the world 's fifteen millionth song to sample quot the big payback quot however r ride the track to r amp b hip hop perfection quot r kelly quot is laced throughout with a distinctively more urban hip hop feel than his debut quot 12 play quot and it work to his advantage much more so than on slightly clunky number like quot 12 quot 's quot back to the hood of thing quot the best example of this from the new record is quot you to be be happy quot where r pair with the late notorious b i g who kick a memorable verse indeed over a bouncy bass laden track there are of course the syrupy sweet ballad like quot step in my room quot and quot love is on the way quot a well a the more r rated song like quot you remind me of something quot where r croons quot you remind me of my jeep i wanna ride it something like my bank account i wanna spend it quot word fail me all in all this album work very well and is a good addition to your r amp b collection 

r kelly 's 1995 self titled album is a classic r b album it 's an album that all music fan must have r kelly is the best r b artist ever he released of 7 album each one i would give a 5 star rating and who ever would n't is crazy but this is his album i would consider his best album it ha 16 of his greatest track ever including his classic hit down low and other great song like thank god it 's friday and hump bounce cop this album you ca n't have a music collection without it 

one of my favorite album by r this is when we had to realize this brother is talented this album wa good because he had some of his love song on it then the song to make you groove and threw in some spirtual song to round it off there is something for everyone on this cd my favorite cut on this cd 2 hump bounce nice litte groove6 baby baby baby baby baby7 you to be happy8 down low the relationship between he and isley wa born9 i ca n't sleep baby14 temp slow16 trade in my life he wa testifying on this song the whole album is good but the song i listed are the song i play the most 

12 play wa the first actually this joint is a lot more musical and thematically well rounded than it 's predecessor classic joint hump bouncenot gonna hold onyou remind me of somethingstep in my roombaby baby baby baby you to be be happydown low nobody ha to know i ca n't sleep baby if i thank god it 's fridaylove is on the waytempo slowas i look into my lifetrade in my life 

after releasing his best album of his career 12 play r kelly drop another incredible effort in 95 this cd wa kind of a departure from the sexual overtone of 12 play the material here concentrated more on love and romance and spirtually however there are a couple of track here that find mr kelly going back to the formula that work for him on 12 play on such track a you remind me of something and tempo slow these two song could have easily been on 12 play the best moment on this cd is when it concentrate on love that evident on such track religious love if i baby baby baby baby these song mr kelly sings with such heart and conviction other note worthy selection be happy you to be step in to my room thank god it 's friday a great effort from one the best in r amp b today if you missed out on this the first time do yourself a favor pick it up you dont know what you 're missing 

mystikal set up shop with his unorthodox style and flow on this groundbreaking debut in 1995 mystikals style wa unlike any other in the rap game his cadence use of swift tongue twisting flow voice variation etc etc etc made him an instant superstar his first hit here i go wa the hardest song when it dropped i do n't care what you say that song is probably one of the hardest song if not the hardest song to ever come out of the south this is a real battle track dedicated to who ever wanted to test with line like you wanna battle bring a body bag i'm gonna need it to carry yo stupid a `ill mess you up with the quickness `you can bring yo whole posse punk i still wont lose ill stomp your whole staff must want a bloodbath you wanna fight punk put em up how that sound come get knocked down this is just a non stop lyrical assault delivered with unparalleled aggressiveness and poise definitely a classic track just because that song is so great doe n't mean the rest of the album is weak mystikal drop some unforgettable quotables and chorus on this album his technique is that straight fire delivering confident line like i know yall people ca n't mess with me because i ca n't mess with my damn self and the only way to keep my mfing name out your mfing mouth is to keep yo mfing mouth shut mystikal could n't possibly be stopped every single song on here is the joint but my favorite include yall aint ready yet mr hood critic not that nicca remix i'm here i go and beware the beat are off the chain and perfectly compliment mystikals style overall you should make every effort to hear this album it is definitely a classic album that is nearly untouchable this is a diamond in the rough extremely recommended 

this album is awesome the best song are ya 'll ai n't ready yet beware mr hood critic i'm out that boot camp clicc here i go ya 'll ai n't ready yet remix this album is definately worth getting 

before mystikal became mundane he wa putting out southern rap classic like this album when you listen to y'all aint ready yet and here i go you can tell that mystikal put effort into his rap and wasnt going through the motion like he doe now out that boot camp clicc remains a one of my favorite track from mystikal a for flaw there are none this album wa mystikal at his best i really think he messed up when he decided to go commercial and put out lackluster material four album later bottom line mind of mystikal is one of the best release in 1995 and is mystikal 's best album the production wa cool and mystikal wa hungry a hell back then standout track yall aint ready yet original and remix murderer beware i'm here i go out that boot camp clicc mind of mystikal not that n never gone bounce the dream 

mystikal is definitely at his best on this album nowadays kal ai n't all that and of course with his rape charge i guess he put out the greatest hit to get some kind of an appeal goin haha yea thats kinda wrong but hey it the truth i guess but this album along with unpredictable and ghetto fabulous are his absolute best work i have all 3 and still bump every one of them definitely worth your money pick it up 

1995 new orleans' mystikal get his chance to shine this album is a far cry from his shake ya a joint from 2000 or tarantula album from 2001 which i have and is a fun and funny commercial album this album is definitely gangsta and ha an underground feel to it mystikal ha a unique and original flow and at time give off an angry vibe i do not know much about his rape charge from a few year ago and some may let that color their opinion about him people make mistake but that cannot take away from the quality of this album since the two have nathan to do with each other beat are simply fantastic southern fried funk and crunk precise edward produce these phat beat y'all ai n't ready yet ha a dope n'awlins jazzy deep bass beat he shuts down mark with funny punchlines and ha a humorous bragadoccio murderer is whiny and rattly crunk meet g funk and is lyrically menacing he is angry about his sister michele tyler being killed and want revenge the hook is angry with him moaning cop murder n z at night mr hood critic is melodic g funk with mystikal calling out hater and how he wo n't let them get him down the beat is relaxed and sweet while mystikal spit hard and fast mystikal also go hard on the crunk inflected not that n a i like the scratch on i'm and the fast adrenaline rush paced beat another crunk banger see the crunk from this period wa different than now now it is over commercialized but stuff like this is fun and exciting i am relatively new to the sub genre i used to only look at a club mainstream crap like it often is now not always though think new 3 6 or ugk mystikal flow over the beat with ease he can rap fast over the slower beat a effective a he can over the fast one this album establishes him a a force in the rap game i never heard unpredictable or ghetto fabulous off of no limit jive but i hear they are good too this is a must have classic 

people know mystikal can rap and that 's something that make let's get ready and tarantula tight but people forget before he wa quot bouncin' back quot and makin' chick quot shake it fast quot mystikal wa tellin' people they quot ai n't ready yet quot mind of mystikal made people notice he wa n't a come n go rapper which he prove a lot through this c d every track is tight in some case lyrically and comically if you heard this c d you know it 's tight if not then you missin' out 

this is a personal classic of mine the album dropped almost 9 year ago i cant believe it been that long overall it one of the best hip hop album ever produced bun b and pimp c rip the beat apart classic material throuout if ya have n't come across this album pick it up now you 'll love it 

a great album by one of the pioneer rap group to make it big out of the south much love ugk one love bun b rip pimp c 

one day ha always been a favorite of mine from ugk i had to replace this cd in my collection 

port arthur texas' own pimp c and bun b return for the third time with ridin' dirty underground kingz start the album off with a touching reality song about life on one day featuring 3 2 over a soulful southern instrumental next on murder a more up tempo track with a continuous loop a the duo each take on a verse for a classic old school feel pinky ring ha a funk sample a pimp c sings the hook the southern accent are apparent but on diamond wood it contains a dj screw sample for the chorus on a late night tip 3 in the mornin' is a tale of being out in the street during the wee hour of the day f my car is about how woman choose by what type of car they drive they take it back to the street with that 's why i carry featuring n o joe on the reason why they carry gun ugk reach for higher ground and spiritual guidance on hi life for another aspect that 's still non mainstream but a club swinging tune good stuff will have listener bouncing and nodding their head to this laid back sound to end the lp off with the title track for clean and clear production outro is a shout out track by pimp c over another laid back track to complete the mood and overall fell of ridin' dirty seven of the thirteen track were produced by underrated ugk 's own pimp c underground kingz took u for a ride with good instrumentation lyric and presentation for southern hip hop rap 

yesterday wa a sad day for rap hip hop a official found chad pimp c butler 1 2 of the group u g k dead in his hotel room in los angeles it 's a shame that such a talented artist who helped elevate southern rap died at a young age he wa 33 in memory of him i decided to spin their third album on jive record ridin' dirty an album full of funky laid back production and some great wordplay by both bun b and pimp c just how i like it hearing this album there are song on here that reflect on life such a one day hearing the hook on that song is so depressing a well a hi life a song about the duo getting their life straight the former song feature rap a lot member tre deuce mr 3 2 and he also appears on touched another standout would be diamond wood ha an excellent chopped screwed sample for a hook that make the song impressive other great song on here are f my car a well a the mello funky bass track ridin' dirty i would say that the latter is my favorite song on this lp because the song is so laid back the album end with the outro a pimp c giving shoutouts overall this album is a southern classic this is a huge improvement over their previous albumsuper tight i'm glad i picked this up a while ago because this album dropped in 1996 and it still sound fresh today the production on here is excellent comming close to such funky album asget in where you fit inor along those line most of the song on here clock in at over five minute so there is plenty of funk for a listener to digest to tell you the truth i also believe this album wa slept on and should have made ugk a household name this is one i recommend everyone especially fan of southern rap to check this out this album is not too expensive a of now so that give you a reason to give it a listen it 's one of those album you can just pop in roll one up if you smoke and just ride to trust me you 're going to feel this one if you know how southern rap is supposed to sound like it 's sad now that the pimp is gone because southern rap will never be the same rest in peace pimp c peace much lovelyrics aproduction a guest appearance amusical vibe a top 5 track 1 ridin dirty2 diamond wood3 one day featuring tre deuce 4 good stuff5 hi life 

u g k 's 1996 album ridin' dirty is a great showcase of texas hip hop that would prove very influential rapper pimp c and bun b were already two album deep when they dropped this one and in my opinion it 's the best album they 've ever released ridin' dirty is an album that 's centered around simple yet very appealing production the laidback groove are bass heavy and funky but without the synths horn and extra instrumentation you might see on a g funk album of this era they 're rolling beat meant for top down cruising and chilling and nine of the album 's thirteen track are five minute or longer most song are pretty hooky and the chorus are either rapped or delivered by a female singer this can add or take away from the given song on ridin' dirty former rap a lot in house producer n o joe is very involved here and he 's one of the south 's finest producer ever i do n't think anyone would ever call pimp c and bun b lyrical genius but for the most part what they lack in pure lyricism they make up for in style and character their tale of crime violence and woman or their talk of car and materialism are not out of the ordinary for a gangsta rap record at all however they both have very distinctive delivery and unique drawl and accent that could not be mistaken for anyone but texas native they have good flow and chemistry working very well together ridin' dirty ha a few truly classic cut and the rest of the song are pretty good there 's only a very few that i do n't really like so it 's actually a pretty consistent work i do n't believe it 's a classic on the level of some of scarface or geto boys' work but it 's one of the finest album to come from the hot houston scene of the mid 90 i highly recommend ridin' dirty to fan of southern or even west coast rap it 's a great album for the car and the summertime and it 's very entertaining after the intro come one of my two favorite song on the album one day using a classic isley brother sample and the album 's greatest rolling bass heavy beat pimp c and bun b deliver some of their best rhyme in a laidback manner the depressing subject matter and perfect production make this song a true southern classic murder is tough and upbeat but still ha the heavy riding quality of the slower song on this album pinky ring is fast and funky it 's not my favorite because the flossy lyric do n't really go anywhere and i do n't like the hook diamond and wood is a showcase of the excellent slow and funky production at it best it 's great to just let it roll for over five minute 3 in the mornin' come next a solid track but not one of the best the production is simple and the hook is n't great the 3 2 collaboration touched is very good it 's got some mid tempo catchy funk to make your head nod and this is the song with the infamous now once upon a time not too long ago a n a like myself had to strong arm a h verse f my car is about deceptive woman some basic gangsta rap the n o joe aided that 's why i carry is nice and i also like hi life a profile of the crime ridden life of a successful hustler the nice but not too memorable good stuff come before the absolutely classic title track i totally love this song it 's one of the most laidback chilled out rap song ever the production is just awesome and the lyric and hook do it perfect justice the outro is almost ten minute long and not worth listening to more than once even though it ha a nice beat because it 's just spoken shout out in my opinion ridin' dirty is the best album u g k ever put together and it 's a really fun listen it 's not perfect by any mean but it 's certainly worth owning for any hip hop fan the deep groove rough style and southern drawl will have most listener coming back for more i'm sure if you like this album i might also recommend u g k 's first two albumstoo hard to swallowandsuper tight a well a scarface 'sthe diaryand e s g 'ssailin' da south 

exactly 14 year on this day record store across the country put a cd on the shelf that changed and set the tone for hip hop and music in general if you ask me ridin' dirty wa that album year previous before this album dropped i argued that the chronic wa the best album front to back until this one dropped not to take anything from the chronic but this one split it 's fair share of speaker pimp c himself said something to the effect that he wanted to make an album on that level and be in the zone dr dre wa in i can damn near rap to this whole cd but the track that stand out the most to me is the following murderdiamonds wood3 in the mornin'touchedthat 's why i carryhi lifeoutroso what i plan on doing is playing this one off and on throughout this weekend a i ride through this city called houston and pay homage to 2 of my favorite rapper pimp c rip and bun b 

i'm unsure if the source reviewed this album back in '96 but if they did i'm sure the reviewer s gave it a rating which just did n't do it justice they rarely do unless it 's something bubblin from the east i grew up on u g k but this album came out around the time when i wa really beginning to appreciate the culture of hip hop and rap so i kind of came of age on this one and still 9 year later ridin dirty is still in my top pick of best classic album of our generation or any period listening to the introspective sometimes too real lyric from the mind of bun b and pimp c will do a mind job on you these brother have been through some stuff topic that get touched are dealing in the street scandalous woman zoning out on how the human experience can be cut short shiest family member being afraid to sleep because of the street and how the high slice of american pie is basically unattainable for particular individual at time these cat get so deep you ca n't help but think that their venting on this album is a mental mind release and almost a silent plea for help and if not help at least silently begging the listener to just lend them an ear so you can understand what go on in their average day this is trill music these brother are talented especially the incredible pimp c who handled a little more than half of the slick production on the album bun b 's insance breath control sharp word and often witty lyricism remains unmatched in the game even by wordy east coast emcee bun b is still holdin it 's a screaming shame that pimp c wa locked up recently check out their back catalog a well a the immensely underrated and slept on branch off group mddl fngz some homeboy of bun 's from houston peace 

ugk 's third album is the album when they came with it lyrically their other album were built around thumping groove and sample with playalistic rhyme about life while they still rap about their life now they are ripping song to shred bun b come into his own on this album and prof why his name is mentioned among the most slept on mc 's ever to grace a mic the production a always is excellent and the sample are still going on on this album and if there wa ever a song to pop that collar to it would have to be pinky ring that song is for the playas around the way the album 's title ridin dirty doe the album justice a it is perfect for your car while you are just cruising around diamond wood is just playalistic cruising with one hand on the wheel seat back in that gangsta lean just chillin and ridin i would compare this album to outkast 's first album spcm every joint is borderline classic if not a classic 3 in the mornin one day f my car the title track and hi life are all bumping track any true hip hop fan should have at least heard this album and more likely than not own it somehow someway dirty south masterpiece five star easily 

this album rank up there with na 's illmatic jay z 's reasonable doubt dr dre 's chronic and the first three a tribe called quest album ridin' dirty is so smooth and it still bang in my ride and this album is 7 year old the best song are one day murder pinky ring diamond wood and my personal favorite along with track 5 is hi life because that song is so real these are no sugarcoated powder puff rapper that you hear on the radio ugk is too real get ugk 's entire collection because they never put out a wack album even their side hustle album which is more like a guest appearance greatest hit is their worst album and that 's bangin' 

the best group of the south put out one of the best album i ever heard i have over 700 for their 3rd group effort rightfully earning the name underground kingz on this one 2 year after their 4 5 star super tight the boyz from port arthur come out strong only 11 song and nowhere near a weak spot on the album except possibly the skit 4 are classic 2 are almost classic and the other 5 are good or great song production is great a well pimp c doe 5 song n o joe doe 4 and sergio doe 2 guest rap on 2 song and do the hook on a few so you get alot of pimp c and bun b a definite classic that everyone should own one of the best rap album ever period 2 8 f 3 2 3 10 classic w great beat and some great hard verse 4 9 5 another great beat 5 8 5 6 10 classic w great beat f big smokin mitch 7 10 another classic great beat f 3 2 8 8 9 10 classic w great beat f n o joe some more hard verse 10 9 good relaxing beat f n o joe 11 9 5 upbeat song about smokin f reginald hackett 12 8 5bun b bernard freeman b 1973 port arthur txpimp c chad butler b 12 73 d 12 4 07 port arthur txunderground kingz check all my review 

ridin' dirty is most def some of pimp c bun b 's best great southern fried funk with a hard gangsta lean these guy pioneered southern hip hop this is the real deal if ya like some fresh country flava with your beat cop this 

these boy do it right i have never had a rap album that ha been this good for this long i can listen to this album all the way through it amazing that they made this album in the early 90 and how it still remains ground breaking my all time favorite rap album ever 

this is one of those cd 's that you can just let play because every song is good two of the best rapper in the south and one of the best cd buy it 

classic cd represents the south good with song like one day murder hi life and ridin dirty make this cd good for the collection they even give dj screw prop in a song better cd then dirty money with pimp c 's smooth flow and bun b 's lyric make this cd a keeper free pimp c 

great cd my favorite from ugk rip pimp c this cd look better then the original i used to own 

long before chamillionaire wa ridin' dirty which wa questionably changed to simply ridin' when it made radio wave on the chart the underground kingz were ridin' dirtier than anyone else in the game and to this day this is still one of the grimiest record to come from the dirty south this is arguably ugk 's greatest album although dirty money is also a classic album and wa quite a few year before ugk were first exposed to the mainstream with hova 's big pimpin' some people new to the game probably think that bun b who make a guest appearance on seemingly every southern rapper 's album is some new cat who 's trying to make wave in the underground while i can see why they 'd think this bun b is always hungry when he rap leading one to believe he 's trying to make an impact on the industry despite the fact he already ha made a significant one bun b ha been in the biz for well over a decade alongside his partner in rhyme although 'in crime' maybe more appropriate for pimp c than it is for most pimp c together they 're the underground kingz who identify themselves by the acronym of ugk when they first came into the game the south wa obscure now that it 's blown up especially their native land of texas one would think that ugk would get better publicity unfortunately the kingz' publicity still doe n't compare to their skill and only true head have been able to check out their undeniably dope music hailing from port author they may not be houstonians but they still posse the love of flossin' and grindin' a well a slow hypnotic beat and equally entrancing flow on ridin' dirty ugk provide one of the most revered music to ever come from the south and for good reason while one may criticise them for their admittedly limited subject matter whip drip chip tip and trick they deliver their rap with so much finesse and style that you ca n't help but overlook these issue no matter how much these thing are rapped about ugk always provide an interesting take on them complete with captivating rhyme and superb flow their production just a somber yet hypnotic a their flow highlight i 'd say this album ha gem but in all honesty it 's a complete gold mine every single track on this album is a five star cut and even the outro ha a dope enough beat to warrant it that label despite the fact it 's all shout out whether it 's the smoothed out isley sampled one day the gritty murder the southern anthem diamond wood or the impressive showing of wordplay on touched which jay z lifted a verse from on 99 problem this album ha something for every hip hop head if you 're a fan of southern rap then you need this album if you 're a detractor of southern rap you also need to this album to show you just how great it is if you 're a head who is n't prejudice to coast or region this album will have constant rotation and you too will be able to appreciate the dopeness that is ugk 

these boy done f amp ked around and got a triple double with this the production on here is rich and deep you can play this on your granmama 's ol' clock radio and it gonna make you sit up and lissen it 's true tho they aint sayin a whole lot reference to drug and sex are integrated into damn near every verse but they are so skilled in creating lyrical landscape and the production is so tight that true hip hop fan wont complain too much but if you want insight and meaning then check out mo def talib outkast or any of the old school recording that are still out there these boy only wanna keep it crunk 

im from baltimore some rather most do n't really listen to the southern stuff maybe outkast or stuff like that commercial but i do n't care where your from what you like or do n't like you have to love this cd i never took this out of the car you know how some cd make it back to the cd book shelf or garbage this never since i bought it in 2000 i feel bad for sleeping on it that long ha ever came out of any of the ride through all of the flight it flew with me if you cant feel this cd ridin in the night around 3 in the mornin i ca n't help you this cd set the mood for any on road situation whether you drinkin smokin got a little shorty in ride witcha or you doing something you dont have any damn business doing or you just ridin dirty by your damn self just zoning out it get no better down south and or north when your rolling then ridin dirty 

delivery b lyric a production astyle a consistensy a overall a 

comin out of texas ugk 's third full length jive album ridin' dirty is contradictious because the rhyme are dirty but the beat are clean a hell the album is bumpin' from start to finish the production is some of the best i have ever heard from any region south north west east whatever production is held by pimp c 3 2 n o joe and sergio beat are heavy southern g crunk and deep fried funk with some smoother joint the lyricism is awesome i love the way these two flow and complement each other one day produced by 3 2 is a deeper song about the unpredictable way of life and how some head are really trippin' over a gorgeous faster twangy isley sampled beat murder is a crazy and awesome crunk type joint with heated flow check the bass on this one hi life is smoother slow rollin' g funk dropping street sociology about the drug trade cycle a classic a cool street jam is that 's why i carry over a heavy n o joe he also rap the hook this one explains why they stay strapped good stuff is a danceable twangy sex joint pinky ring is a dope pimpin' joint with deep twang just listen to those guitar riff a nice joint to roll in the cady with the fuzzy dice hangin' off the mirror you can hear the dj screw influence in diamond and wood beat by pimp c a slower crunkish joint an awesome rider anthem for flossin' your whip 3 in the mornin' is perfect for the late night cruise the beat is relaxed g funk influenced but with le melody this ha to be their best album it just ha an awesome vibe to it and is one of my favorite album in my collection and the album is a pinnacle and a standard setter for southern rap this is my first ugk album and it solidified me a afan of theirs 

positive a really laid back album that 'll keep you in a relaxed mood both member of underground king have really distinct voice and tight southern accent an all around nice album to bump when you just want to sit back and chill negative nothing here for those who want inventive or quot meaningful quot topic in their rap this is n't exactly dead prez or common these guy do n't have the lyrical skill of someone like pac eminem or canibus 

this album in my opinion is a definate classic alot of rapper today that are from the south really got influenced by this one you can tell by all the sample they use in their song and some of the song title liek chamillionaire 's ridin' dirty for example bun b and pimp c 's best album also if you like ol' skool gangsta rap or southern rap this is a must buy top track one daymurderpinky ringdiamonds woodhi life 

back in 1995 when i wa in 7th grade i saw these guy perform in my middle school lunch room before anyone knew who they were they had those little pre teen girl soaking wet the blond haired kid hit piercingly high note i wa completely baffled by this a i sat back and ate my cream corn and mini corn dog so i bought the cassette tape then the lady were all talking to me they were like hey chad can i listen to the b boy on your headphone and i wa like ah yeah baby come over here and sit on my lap and we can listen to the sweat sound of the b boy together he he he he he backstreet 's back alright 

terrific pop cd ha some of the best song of the late ninety on it quot a long a you love me quot and quot quit playing game with my heart quot were smash hit and are still favorite on soft rock station all over usa now there is a lot of controversy over if backstreet or 'n sync that other group are better i like both but backstreet boy always will be my favorite they 're the king of ballad and have a couple great up beat song mostly on this one 'n sync are the more hip hoppy group if you like that stuff their first cd wa great and i thought the second that everyone is fussing over is horrible there 's only about two good song on it so i definately say to get this the backstreet boy debut and their second release millenium if you like these you 'll probably like 'n sync 's first cd too you wo n't be disappointed with any of these three 

loved this cd when i wa 12 when it 1st came out i 've been a huge bsb fan every sense the cd wa like new great quality no scratch nothing now that i have it it 's scratched lol played to much 

the backstreet boy became highly admired dominantly by young girl just like new kid on the block in the late 80 's and early 90 's in 1997 when this album wa released it sold by the dozen just like hanson 's middle of nowhere album hit song include everybody backstreet 's back quit playing game with my heart i'll never break your heart all i have to give and a long a you love me all later recycled for 2001 's the hit chapter one set adrift on memory bliss contains music excerpt for spandau ballet 's true personally this album like every other bsb album i believe is one of the greatest ever recorded it continued to sell well throughout 1998 how could that be they just started 

i got backstreet 's debut album a couple year after it came out but i still thought it wa pretty good quot quit playing game quot quot a long quot quot all i have quot quot everybody quot and quot never break quot are all enough to make you want to buy this album although bsb is adored by million of pre teen girl you should n't totally dismiss this album however this is their first album and they have gotten much better over the year i never understood how this music is considered quot pop quot when all it is r amp b but that 's all a part of a critic 's job to neatly place everyone in a particular musical category 

a a person with a variety of musical taste loving everyone from bjork who is my all time favorite to loreena mckennitt to mel c you get the idea you can pretty much tell that i realize that this is n't the deepest music but who care a duke ellington said quot if it sound good it is good quot so i do n't see why everybody feel like they have to hate fun music that get you through the day even if song twelve of this album is something le than savory in sentiment i like the backstreet boy a lot and i think this album is just great boy band music is always fun unless they do too many ballad and a a great lover of dance club and overall danceable and enjoyable music i play this album a whole lot and even if two of the ballad are slightly boring and both start with someone whispering quot baby quot there 's something kind of sweet about them though their second album a a whole ha slightly better overall production and is more introspective and thoughtful and is i think preferable to this this is still a great album and is great fun so if you just want something fun and nice to listen and dance to buy this album i think you 'll really enjoy it and even be caught bouncing around the room to it alot 

the whole pop culture wa really kinda dead for a while then all of a sudden a bunch jump on the scene sellin record to the mass bye the million they seem to be still coming but im tellin ya now 2 3 year down the road only a couple will still be here here at least sellin record anyways however i do think the backstreet boy will be one of the few still standing im not sure about 5 year though at that point pop culture will slow back down again then repeat all over not because of talent but because of pop music being so trendy if u look back to some of the past pop star or even r amp b star u will see there reign on top is short with always a few exception if u love this music dont worry if the group or artist you like fall off or stop sellin cuz this million dollar industry will find someone to replace them and it wont be a long wait i promise thats just how it work however i do feel that this record is alot tighter than a lot of other pop record that have come out in the last couple year quit playin game with my heart a long a you love me everybody and set adrift of memory bliss r all good song this is a great album for any collection that is filled by r amp b and pop 

so i admit that i wa a huge backstreet boy fan when they came out but then again so wa n't anyone my age to say now that they suck would be unfair to the genra of music that they profess they are bubblegum pop and in that effect they deliver decent bubblegum pop this is not their best album for it wa their debut and their sophmore album wa much more polished but the hit turned out by this album were plenty and this album did solidify them quite the fanbase thanks to whiny girl come back to me type lyric and nick carter just plain whiny voice not sure what the hype is there for him but oh well the backstreet boy had it all they had the young cute one ala nick carter they had the talented one ala brian they had the drug addict ala a j they had the funny looking one ala howie and they had the creepy older guy ala kevin and they could carry a note for the most part thus the backstreet boy were born and teenage girl everywhere went crazy i admitt that i liked this cd even though my friend thought i wa nut all but a few but how can you resist song like quit playing game with my heart or a long a you love me everybody wa huge and so wa all i have to give and the balance of the cd wa n't to bad either no it 's not in my cd player right now and no it wo n't visit anytime soon but for what it wa for the time it came out and for the fan base they were after backstreet boy came saw and conquered 

i have this cd but i am not playing it that often in fact this album is sitting on my shelf for week or month on end my u2 depeche mode and enya cd are getting a lot of spin a long a you love me and everybody are good in my opinion i do enjoy the halloween video for everybody it wa one of the best video i had seen in a long time back then in 1997 meanwhile song like hey mr dj a cover version of set adrift on memory and if you want to be good girl are just plain awful to the point to being almost unlistenable the rest are ok the music on here is very teen oriented with some blue eyed soul influence i m not very fond of this cd not that i call it bad but just so many other cd i have get many time more spin in my cd player backstreet boy would improve dramatically on their millennium album two year after this one but would come crashing to the ground with the oh so boring black and blue 

i remember this album when i wa the 5th and 6th grade this album is a keeper this album is armed with powerful harmony groove friendly beat passionate ballad a dynamic stage show and charisma that will not be denied they were ready to show usa what the rest of the planet ha already figured out they are more than a phenomenon they are here to stay this album ha been certified 14x platinum remember this wa 1997 1998 

when i first heard quit playing game on the radio i went crazy trying to find out who sung it who had every heard of the backstreet boy anyway well no one is asking that question anymore since these great looking talented young guy have risen in the music world and can sell out a stadium in le than 10 minute this cd contains all their popular hit from the late ninety you 'll sing along and dance and really enjoy adding this to your quot favorite quot collection and of course millennium is out of this world too 

wa n't this album available in the state then that is suprising to say the least a it wa all over canada the bsb 's were kinda the start of the commercially put together boy band craze at least since this album came out it seems that every guy and his brother want to be in a boy band even though nearly every guy will profess that they hate the bsb 's and all boy band however i must admit that the song are catchy and danceable and on the whole harmless fun but certainly nothing that will last for generation a hundred year from now heck 50 year from now they will be forgotten along with britney but for now they are here so enjoy while you can 

i am picky about my pop but i actually really liked it it 's a guily pleasure all the song are catchy and danceable liked this much better than n'sync 's debut 

yep backstreet boy have ever remained my fav' star since their singing debut 'quit playing game with my heart' and everybody rock your body' millennium proved to be the best hit pick in my list and sure sure backstreet boy cd is a prize collection in the closet brian is cool so is nick n rest and this is one group one ca n't resist to listen to their catchy sweet ballad n dance number quit playing game and a long a you love me are great number hey mr dj is a song to hum n hope it keep playing along if you wanna be a good girl get a bad boy is sweet lyric coz make me smile at the word and is a pretty number smartly conveying the message all i have to give is a nice ballad singing blue of a girlfriend tear i 'll never break your heart is an emotion through lyric the group is a unique togetherness and ha topped the chart with their 'larger than life' great pick if you like the pop n ballad n cool listen my choice enjoy 

before i get any hate mail i would like to state for the record that i own a copy of this cd i am not bashing this cd because i love nsync in fact i do n't intend to truly be bashing this cd in anyway these are just my feeling about this particular album now here i go this cd is awful the production alone merit this a a single star the drum and background portion of the music drowned out the vocal the vocal are somewhat okay most of the album is done through their nose and being a musician myself this drive me crazy when it is n't done through their nose they strain their vocal cord which make it even worse and could nick be any flatter on half of the note the actual song the music of the song and the lyric are n't that great they 're full of grammatical error there are also some point when the harmony do n't blend correctly this cd sound like it wa thrown together in a matter of second and had no hard work or effort put into it i strongly recommend that you avoid this cd 

the only reason i gave this c d a chance wa because my girlfriend happens to love these moronic disgrace of music 4 song on this 12 song album were decent the rest were shoddy production and too poppy quot quit playing game with my heart quot a great song ha an rnb feel to it quot a long a you love me quot great lyric and the groove is catchy quot all i have to give quot fairly decent i have to be in the mood to listen to it quot everybody quot the only reason i like this damn song is because i saw the video so many time i have the lyric imbedded in my brain the rest suck im sorry but after artist like quot prince quot quot stevie wonder quot quot michael jackson quot paved the way for these young swill merchant you think anyone would make good music well these puppet for the record company suck no punn intended if you like this kind of music go listen to savage garden at least they have talent these moron do n't and im out 

ok some people may just pas on the backstreet boy simply because they think they are just another one of those teenybopper face band that will become very big then just grow quot un cute quot and disappear into the 99 cent bin in a few year remember new kid on the block thought so that is what happened to them now what make the backstreet boy different is that they have pure singing talent listen to their harmony solid listen to their song they all can sing they can sing lead they can do back ups they even play instrument which i have recently seen from some concert footage talent people all talent i think the backstreet boy will be around for awhile just listen to them 

the album opener 'everybody backstreet 's back ' is handsdown one of the best party song of the 90 and of the boy along with the intoxicating 'if you want it to be good girl get yourself a bad boy ' 'as long a you love me' still is a lovely love ballad about unconditional love and ha never gotten old to me a i still hear it being played over the radio '10 000 promises' 'like a child' 'that s what she said' and 'if i do n't have you' are very romantic song that further captured how much the boy love to sing about love not to mention how wonderful their singing voice are 'all i have to give' is such a beautiful love ballad on the album and ha always been my favorite from the boy and speaks about what real love is 'that 's the way i like it' which might had been sampled for the boy 'millennium' song 'larger than life' is a swell mid tempo song a well a 'hey mr dj keep playing this song 'set adrift on memory bliss' is a very smoothing which should n't be overlooked along with the other song from the album that were n't major hit single the second album from bsb ha what their debut album ha a few catchy dance and funky song but ha more love ballad which display how really talented nick a j howie d brain and kevin are 

the backstreet boy started out europe because they felt that the u were'nt ready them yet and when they released this cd it caused them to explode into the usa spawning 5 top 10 hit single this cd is a great mix of pop and r amp b however i hated the cover of pm dawn 's quot set adrift on memory bliss quot it one of my fav song and they murtilized it but the rest of the cd is really good beginning with the dancy song quot we 've got it going on quot the first hit single in the u quot quit playing game with my heart quot quot a long a you love me quot my personal fav on the album very catchy and a cute song track five is quot all i have to give quot i love this song it just a really great song track 7 is one of the best ballad of all time quot i 'll never break your heart quot it so sweet and the harmonizing is amazing also the track if you have the newer album version with quot everybody backstreets back quot that 's a great dance track get down you 're the one fore me is a really good dancer too i love the last track quot if you want it to be good girl get yourself a bad boy quot it pretty funny catchy sexy and cute all at the same time so go buy this album and the rest of bsb 's album 's cause they all rock the house 

it 's amazing how these guy keep fooling people i ask you do they write their song or some clever professional songwriter do that for them i have absolutely nothing against ballad and pop but when that sound a complete fake that piss me off 

talent le in every sense of the word the music is dated new jack amp the vocal are plain boring all of their music is formula avoid at all cost just like all the other boy band 

this is the greatest cd of all time though millennium is a very close second this cd ha it all my faves are quot quit playing game quot quot we 've got it going on quot quot i 'll never break your heart quot quot everybody quot and quot backstreet 's back quot because they all have their own sound the backstreet boy are my favorite group now and forever i hope kevin and brian have very happy successful marriage but just incase keep my e mail 

very stratified with the item good album from start to finish quality production and hot track bsb brought back the boyband fad with this one 

backstreet boy broke big in europe and asia before they finally broke the u market their debut album wa released internationally in 1996 but it would take another year before it wa released in the u nevertheless it is amazing to me that it 's been 15 year since this wa released backstreet boy 12 track 52 min start with an incredible infectious we 've got it going on what an opening track it is followed by the pleasant mid tempo quit playing game with my heart and the ballad a long a you love me but then thing get even better with the rebel rousing everybody backstreet 's back the best track on here and the best bsb track ever period not that bsb wa away a this wa their first album but hey who 's minding great track follow one after another such a the pensive all i have to give and the dance alongs hey mr dj keep playin' this song and get down you 're the one for me but truth be told there are no weak track on here and sound like a greatest hit album 15 year on this album stand the test of time and it is amazing to me how fresh it still sound compared to say the spice girl a few year later who now sound very dated this is the best bsb album period i saw the bsb in concert once in 1999 at the peak of the bsb nsync boy band craze i went on a date to be honest and what a great show it wa meanwhile this album wa and is a major musical guilty pleasure 

i'm not gonna say that i expected better of this album because i seriously did n't i knew this album wa going to be the start of a horrible era the boyband era all over again i knew that this album wa going to suck once i heard we got it goin' on but i have to admit i tried to be fair and like at least one song but i just could n't every song is so damn obnoxious and so manufactured it 's almost a if you 're forced not to like them unless of course you 're a girl in her teen willing to scream for any group with a little sex appeal sure all the song make you wanna kill yourself if you actually listen to good music but the most annoying are definitely everybody backstreets'back back from where and the horrible vomit worthy cover of set adrift on memory bliss and the vocal lord save me now nick carter sound like a deeper version of alanis morisette on crack sorry for insulting a music genius like you alanis i ca n't think of one good thing about this trash except that you actually like the song for about 3 second until you come back to reality sure they 're a manufactured boy band and that 's bad enough but they could 've at least given a 2 star effort the verdict why this sold so much is beyond me recommended i think you know my answer 

i still think that backstreet boys' u debut is still a solid pop debut the max martin dominated song like quit playing game a long a you love me and others are still superb pop song there are some funky number like hey mr dj and we 've got it going on i still love the breezy ballad darlinwith it lush landscape and bridge it wa smart that they added everybody to the album in early '98 made the album have more energy to it this helped start the boy band trend of nearly identical male group even a rival group which i wo n't say here the singing 's very good a aj mclean and nick carter 's twin lead along with brian littrell 's inclusion make the song entertaining kevin richardson and howie dorough provide good background singing i still love good girl bad boy and it rocking closing to the album it ha that ac dc type feel to it with it naughtiness this is a landmark album of many proportion 

i 've been a huge fan of the backstreet boy since '97 and i have each and everyone of their album all of them are great this one however is their american debut they 've had two other import album before this one i think it 's a rockin' cd that show the more fun relaxed side of the bsb every song on this cd is awesome well with the exception of one song so here 's the run down we 've got it goin' on this is the very first single the bsb had they first released it in the u but it did n't do very well on the chart so they decided to try europe and it became a major hit this is a groovy upbeat song and the lyric are awesome so are the boys' vocal quit playin' game with my heart you 've all heard this song before i personally love it and it never get boring or old a long a you love me still my favorite ballad on this cd you 've all heard this one too everybody backstreet 's back the cd i have doe n't include this song but i have the single for it and it rock you 've all heard this song so you decide all i have to give a great ballad the vocal and lyric are smooth and solid and so is the music you 've all heard this one i believe anywhere for you a cool love ballad the lyric and vocal are wonderful hey mr dj keep playin' this song an awesome uptempo dance song the lyric are cool and so are the bsb vocal i 'll never break your heart one of my favorite love ballad and what they say is true they never will break my heart beautiful lyric and vocal darlin' ok song brian doe great here but not one of my favorite get down you 're the one for me an awesome uptempo song i just love it the lyric music and vocal are amazing set adrift on memory bliss i think this is the only song by the bsb that i ever disliked it should n't have been included here really bad if you want it to be good girl get yourself a bad boy my favorite uptempo song nick 's lead vocal are awesome i think nick is so gorgeous and talented this song should not be missed all in all terrific cd it 's great for a party or just for having a good time and relaxing nick howie brian aj and kevin were al much younger when they recorded this cd but that doe n't make them bad backstreet boy if you have n't got it yet is the one cd you should n't miss out on this cd rock 

i am glad i bought this cd because it is worth every cent of your money for the first track to the last the boy do a great job introducting themselves to the u i love all the song and it is just a great cd your whole family can listen to 

this album wa released stateside in 1996 but i first heard the backstreet boys' we 've got it going on during a trip to london in 1995 while america wa still in the waning year of grunge london had taken the lead in jumping on the boy band bandwagon with take that so they were the first to embrace the backstreet boy when the boy finally brokethrough in the state i wa thrilled a a teen pop fan from the 70 's and 80 's i wa glad to see it return on this album the boys' youthful exhuberance shine through the song are full of energy and are still fun to listen to all these year later a with most artist their time in the spotlight ha apparently come and gone but who know these boy had talent and we may hear more from them yet whoever thought jordan knight or joey mcintire from new kid on the block would make solo comeback a word of caution this is an enhanced cd which can sometimes be a pain if you want to listen to the cd on your computer without disturbing other program you have running the problem with these enhanced cd 's is that the information becomes out of date and useless my advice is when you first put it in your cd drive and the boy come up on your screen click exit so you can just play the music without all the other unnecessary program running 

say what you will but it 's patently unfair to say that the backstreet boy `suck' granted those of u who have been raised on rock and roll will find it difficult to ascertain the musical appeal of five performer posing a a band singing pseudo soulless version of pre packaged pop emotional swill but we are n't their target audience these guy or rather the people who have manipulated them into the image that they represent have targeted them straight at the heart of pre teen youth culture and a such they have done a better than admirable job for those of u who might have selective memory there have been other much worse example of teen based music that pre date the backstreet boy would anybody care to remember the osmond brother leif garrett fabian in comparison the backstreet boy are downright respectable while music by the aforementioned ha been thoroughly forgotten i think that the backstreet boy have done their job well enough to survive the ravage of time so for all the naysayer who dismiss the backstreet boy a irrelevant i 'll try not to say i told you so when you find yourself humming along nostalgically to quit playing game with my heart in another five year or a long a you love me b tom ryan 

i actually liked this cd even though almost everyone i know hate the backstreet boy i actually think some of their material is actually good this cd wa better then millenium though 1 we 've got it goin' on ok track it sound like everybody backstreet 's back 2 quit playin' game with my heart i liked this pop song it 's one of the reason i bought this album 3 a long a you love me see quit playin' game with my heart 4 everybody backstreet 's back i loved this dance song though it sound like we 've got it goin' on it 's better catchy 5 all i have to give nice ballad 6 anywhere for you see all i have to give 7 hey mr dj keep playin' this song nice dance track catchy 8 i 'll never break your heart see all i have to give and anywhere for you 9 darlin' did n't like it much 10 get down you 're the one for me see hey mr dj keep playin' this song i also liked kevin richardson 's rapping 11 set adrift on memory blisssee darlin' confusing 12 if you want it to be good girl get yourself a bad boy see hey mr dj keep playin' this song overall i really liked this cd except for darlin' and set adrift on memory bliss my favorite song are quit playin' game with my heart a long a you love me everybody backstreet 's back all i have to give hey mr dj keep playin' this song i 'll never break you 're heart get down you 're the one for me and if you want it to be good girl get yourself a bad boy i 'd buy this iif i were you i ca n't wait until the new backstreet boy album come out in september i'm going to buy that one too 

this is very good you even get a tupac appearance ring it is the shiznit you better get this before you get the element this is way better 

one of the best people knock him for his own vernacular his style but he 's a mack e 40 40 fonz my favorite on this cd is million dollar spot with his cousin b legit and homie 'pac my first 40' cd i appreciate the song especially his heartbreaking some thing will never change which sound just like pac change i also love his dis against rasheed wallace who hated on him good music 

i hate e 40 but i gave this 3 star cuz that song quot rapper 's ball quot is off the hook 

most people say that e 40 never topped in a major way but i beg to differ he not only topped it with this album he made it a distant memory i loved in a major way but let be real how many of you remember it after hearing this album exactly the album start off with record hater where e 40 dis the pant off rasheed wallace and az i like az but he wa out of line dissing 40 water and how is rasheed wallace dissing anybody anybody who heard him rap before know that he shouldnt be within 3 point distance of a microphone im talking shaquille o neal wack rapper ball with too short and k ci is a classic joint 2pac rip and b legit join e 40 on the spectacular million dollar spot ring it featuring spice 1 and keek da sneak is another classic joint and why this song wa never an anthem out here still bother me e 40 also ha you covered on the positive tip with the story and thing 'll never change which beautifully sample bruce hornsby 's the way it is some people think i wanna thank you with suga t is corny but is still a highlight track in my opinion circumstance is another bangin track that feature the luniz t pup celly cel and kokane the only track i couldnt feel is my drinking club keep pimpin and growing up he could have left the kid who wa rapping offbeat of that track you know the rest of the album is still noteworthy bottom line e 40 's tha hall of game is his best work and is definetely a highlight album of 1996 this album came out at a time when you can expect most album that come out to be good boy do i miss those day anyway e 40 put a lot effort into this album and it paid off standout track record hater rapper ball million dollar spot the story ring it i like what you do to me things'll never change circumstance and smebbin 

e 40 's the man a weird man but still the man nobody will give this guy a chance to see what skill 40 really pose in no way is he commercial far from it with his goofy voice rapid fire flow and his own personal slang but that 's the beauty of it he 's not like every other rapper straight from vallejo ca adjacent to oakland 40 brings u the hall of game this album show e 40 's fun side and also his more introspective side making this his best album to date if you want party song check out drinking club which production wise sound like 2 yr ahead of it time ring me ha a hot beat with 40 's fire flow and is very danceable and club friendly rapper 's ball the lead single feature the great k ci and too short and is fun if you want hood song check out million dollar spot with the great late 2pac song 3 i forget the name which ha a driveby skit and smebbin with it song about hoe then e 40 take a 180 and rap about introspection the story is a classic followed by circumstance with the chorus saying that you should watch the thing you get into and the company you keep it is what it is is a perfectly narrated eerie story of how the law catch up to you in time and the last song being thing never change which look back on 40 's hard life this dude can rap and is so different than your average rapper that you gotta give him a try you will be impressed he is straight pimpin here and he put together some classic here 40 fonzarelli baby 

back in the day you got classic after classic this is just one of them still though e 40 's new music is great but not this great if you know what i mean this is laid back westcoast music at some of it 's best bay area ha many talented artirst and if you 're into west coast rap e 40 is one of the most important to get i 'll admit this ai n't 40 's best but it 's far from his worst and it doe deserves five star even though it 's more like 4 5 definitely check this out if you 're interested in some west coast talent also check out music by too short south central cartel havoc amp prodeje b legit richie rich the click celly cel oh my god so many talent that never get the prop they deserve i think it 's time now get this for your collection 

this is just a solid a his first and then them b legit is showing the world that the click sucsess wa no fluke and how bright the future for him and the sickwitit family really is from e 40 and the click to the mossie this is the team thats been here since 92 and i do n't see that changin any time soon i wa at philly blunts studio in vallejo back in september of 98 and a heard a new b legit song that wa recorded for his new album and it wa off the hook i hope it make the album watch 4 the new album cuz he keep gettin better 

well if you like the click and are a yea area rap fan this should be one of your favorite i'm sure if you asked more than 100 w coast rap fan if legit can hold his own at least 80 would say he can even though his cousin e 40 blew up the click legit could have blow up himself with a big label backing him b legit ha always had a good solid understandable flow he rap right on the beat kinda like too short he really dose n't need the help of the click but it would be a crime if they did n't rap together c'mon i mean there family now to the album it 's self producer studio ton and mike mosley are never a let down they can always suply none stop mob funk all the song on here u should be able to listen to because legit can flow and the producing is good but if u like legit for his hardcore sound than you 'll do like me and skip over the softer track at time the guess apperances on the album are very good and with all creditable w coast rapper 's c bo kurupt celly cel 40 a1 lil bruce and the mossie singer levitti also add a much needed soulful sound to the album what really suprises me about this album is tha song quot getto smile quot which is a wonderfull remake colaberation of singer daryl hall 's original late 70 's hit quot smile for me quot daryl hall singing the chourus in between legits rap verse also the bonus track 15 not originaly intended to be on the album is a nice gift to all b legits fan

the best album from keith murray all the song have keiths signature lyricism and def squad beat to keep your head knockin' do n't sleep keith 's a genuis with the word 

this cd came out with little publicity at all i'm sure you can tell by the lack of review anyway this cat is nice i first heard this cd in 1996 back then i really wa n't buying music but i ended up copping it in 1999 this is keith murray for real not the quot yeah yeah you no it quot stuff heavily underrated cd 

after a great first album keith murray follows it up with enigma the album doe have it flaw like rhymin wit kel and dangerou ground which wa boring on the dangerous ground soundtrack and is boring now outside of those two joint the album is great call my name manifique original rule how to def and what a feelin show you why keith murray is one of the most underrated eastcoaster i liked his first single the rhyme and the remix is not a bad touch busta rhyme redman erick sermon and jamal totally ripped yeah in half love l o d is another highlight a keith murray kel vicious and 50 grand let of steam on the track keith murray give a touching tribute to his fallen partner on to my man with dave hollister adding to a good chorus bottom line keith murray 's enigma is keith murray at his best and is unquestionably a rap highlight of 1996 keith murray wa still on fire when this album came out so you could expect the best from him standout track call my name manifique original rule the rhyme original and remix what a feelin yeah love l o d to my man and world be free 

original rule out standing song 

back in '97 i believed that hip hop wa changing the previous two year the bay area wa dishing out hit after hit from artist like e 40 the click the luniz too short and the dangerous crew etc mostly around that time due to recent tragedy of tupac and biggie the east coast and the west were showing unity between the two region although on this lp there are no colab from anyone but the west mostly from northern and southern california a a path followed by ant banks'big thangsreleased the same year spice 1 ha dropped a few gem a well along that time his sixth album the black bossalini really come a a real solid lp full of gangsta tale a something that you have mostly have heard from him in the past the first and the easiest standout track would be thug in me a the song is dedicated to his close friend tupac the beat on the song would exactly fit the style of pac the following track i'm high is a song dedicated to smoking weed recognize game feature too short and ice t that is real solid playa man is very lively track a spice 1 ha a sped up flow over the beat yeah i saw that fresh cut he had in the video a well caught in my gunplay is very mellow and laid back sounding me i think it is kind of weak but at the same time solid ballin' is excellent with the beat provided by hen gee and feature caffine yukmouth of the luniz gazzepha and mc breed the bos mobsta is another track to fit spice 1 's style in rapping think of his earlier song 510 213 are ode to the area code of the bay area and los angeles respectively with the help of w c and big syke kill street blue is a great track laced by a nice hook fetty chico and the mack ha a dope beat by ant bank but i'm not feeling the hook or some of the rhyme wanna be a g and diamond are both solid track down payment on heaven is a song dedicated to his deceased homies the final track 2 hand a razorblade is spice 1 telling a story about being locked in the l a county pen spice 1 doe n't dissapoint here on this album but at the same time this is nowhere nearamerikkka 's nightmare which is the only other spice 1 album that i own mainly i do n't own1990 sick a many reviewer are mentioning the album here a many rememerable cut and good production curteosy of paris ant bank and others thankfully jive record ha kept this in print a well a their other popular bay area artist i e too short and e 40 fan of bay area rap will enjoy this here mostly for the track that i said were great peace lyric a production b guest appearance b musical vibe b top 5 track 1 thug in me dedicated to tupac shakur r i p 2 ballin' featuring yukmouth caffeine gazzepha and mc breed 3 the bos mobsta4 kill street blues5 playa manhonorable mention 1 2 hand and a razorblade2 diamond 

i believe the only reason this album is not liked more than he previous effort is purely due to it being he next release the album is more of a 1990 sick part 2 than a knew inovative effort and i think alot of fan expect to much of there rapper to create knew idea and beat instead of just cranking the bass and feeling the beat and bouncing on the ride black bossalini doe this better than sick although both album are simply impressive spice 1 is one of the game best flowing mc pretty much only his trade mark and annoyingly boring blow call take prestige off he name however he ha been given deep riding beat again on this album to work with and it come off in a much enjoyable way the opening 2 track are great opener especially im high it a great song to listen to in that way ant bank steal the show a fetty chico and the mack ha a typical deep funk groove by the master producer and recognize game is up there a one of the best a well ballin is a fun track and diamond is one of the best softer produced track i have heard by any artist the hook is extremely catchy this is spice 1 best in my opinion it make me wonder how he could drop so low with he follow up to this immortalized it not even worth rating 

he doe it again his 5th album is yet another classic to add to his collection of many this man show a he age he still can rap and rap good it ha 3 classic 1 song i skip 1 that 's ok and the rest are good or great production is great and handled by a lot of people paris 4 song ant bank ric rock and ali malek 2 song each and hen gee payback mike mosely each do a song and femi o co produce on 2 track if he had airplay out here on the east coast i 'd bet he 'd have many multi platinum plaque on his wall that 's what 's wrong with rap hardly any of the good rapper sell all th fake a s pu sy 's sell the most if you wanna hear some real rap from a real cat who 's been in the game puttin out album since '88 check out spice 1 get this album 1 10 classic dedicated to his homey 2pac r i p 2 9 song about gettin' high 3 8 f too hort ice t 4 10 classic laid back track 5 6 5 6 9 5 f yukmouth mc breed 7 10 another classic 8 8 mellow track f wc big syke 9 8 5 10 8 f mack 10 11 8 mellow track 12 9 5 13 7 14 8 5b robert lee green in texas around 1971 moved to hayward ca ca n't fu k wit the east bay g check out all my review 

although it 's not a heavy a his other song i 've heard nor a good a 1 800 c o l l e c t it 's good it ha ice t on it mack 10 but thats not what make it good despite it 's shortcoming compared to previous work spice 1 still doe it gritty spice is a good story teller 

on this album spice 1 come out on most of the song a bit le hardcore than the usual i guess he want to change his style a little bit he matured he is le the cold hearted murdera and more like an og playa but still on song like the bos mobsta and 2 hand a razorblade spice ace rip s up and doe what he doe best drop hardcore violent lyric with so much hype and energy that hit yo' face a strong a spice'1 fo fo the production is very tight all over the album and producer include bay area 's finest name such a paris ant bank rick rock and mike mosley the guest list is also very very impressive too short ice t wc big syke mack 10 and others make is a very special album an awesome record make you anticapate the next album by the east oakland thug the one and only spice mutha in' 1 this album is a classic west coast gangsta rap at it 's highest form i love the fact spice 1 even made a tribute to 2pac and it 's not one of those fake a tribute by rapper that pac never ever knew and probably would n't even like to know spice wa real friend with pac and they worked together on several occasion that 's real the album is close to perfection even if his previous album were a bit better spice step his game up and release an album with more of an up to date feel i have nothing but good thing to say about this one keep going spice you 're a legend in this rap game 

late 1997 spice 1 delivers u with his 5th album and his 5th classic in a row intact is his awesome wordplay and thuggish ruggish maniacal flow over great beat this album rate high in his discog producer include ant bank paris clint payback sand hen gee ali malek rick rock mike mosley and femi ojetunde and the beat are a mix of syrupy and melodic g funk and mobb music lyrically he ha a neat array of thug joint and a few deeper song the thug in me is a nice dedication to late homie 2pac rip over a melodic sample and whiny synth spice fire the cheeba on i'm high over a heavier more mobbish beat spice 1 call up wc and big syke from la to kick some game about cali the bay to la anthem 510 213 named after major bay and la area code spice 1 floss a little but still keep it hard on diamond the beat is different bass heavy but softer on the foreground beat with a faint whiny synth the bos mobsta reminds me of 1995 's mind of a sick n a partly because the beat pattern is similar a whodini friend sample and the lyric and spice 's flow are crazy like in the 1995 joint ant banks' beat on the banger street joint recognize game f too short ice t and fetty chico and the mack f mack 10 are among the best on the album down payment on heaven is awesome lyrically and musically too the beat ha neat soulful sample to give it a laidback melodic and deep feel spice 1 contemplates on life death and the thing he ha done doe and may do the drama in the hood and senseless killing that take place there are emphasized in a intellectual fashion 2 hand and a razorblade is another maniacal spice 1 joint about life in the county jail of cali the beat ha a whiny riff reminiscent of snoop dogg 's murder wa the case but the beat is some slick g funk that is subtle but with hardcore overture there is so much to like about this album spice 1 ruled the 1990 's and this classic is a testament to that 

i got next is probably the last album from kr one that anyone owns although i'm not sure if anyone will admit they own this i listened to this album when i first bought it in '97 and i did n't really think it wa all that a shocker because kr usually come correct but then i listened to it again and well i did n't realize just how bad it wa when artist release classic album at the beginning of their career and then some of their following album do n't even come close and they usually do n't people say that 's an unfair comparison because they ca n't be expected to live in the past or how can you compare this to that check comparing any na album or any album to illmatic but after hearing this album you 'll really wish kris stuck to his old style there are many interlude where kris is preaching and they just do n't seem to fit and the only real saving grace on this album are heartbeat with angie martinez and redman who once again steal the show the mc and step into a world even though the latter 's music is slightly irritating the rest of the album is a downer the production and rapping are surprisingly bad and i'm not saying the rapping is bad because he stopped swearing because his last album wa all right remember mc 's act like they do n't know here it 's hard to tell if he even tried blowe ha a very unnecessary and incomprehensible skit at the beginning and the music sound like the battery in somebody 's walkman suddenly went dead kr 's rapping is tired here and even redman come off wack it 's hard to tell if the title track is a rap or a low budget movie and you 'd be slapped silly if you were caught singing along to h i p h o p or the real hip hop part ii what great title huh when kris doe come through on the lyric the track are ruined by the sleepy production especially in a friend when it wa released everyone pretended to like it and over ya head the trumpet doe n't fit and you almost expect kr to start singing but the two last track are the worst just to prove a point is mixing rap and rock that 's commonplace now but back then it did n't sound right and it especially doe n't sound right for him to be screaming like a rock star he 's not even on any kind of beat the final track is a remix of step into a world featuring puff daddy puff is being his typical wack self but it also rub off on kr and what 's kr one doing with puff daddy anyway overall this album is worse than i remembered it i still kept in mind what year this album wa made before i wrote this review but like i said before i did n't like it back then either i hoped kr would redeem himself with subsequent album but according to review those album are n't great either and record sale show that they 're just collecting dust anyway wherever the real kr one is hiding i wish he 'd come out 

kr ha never been the type to follow trend or fad he just continue to bring u that classic hip hop i got next is another lp where kris give u a variety of lyrical style like the title over ya head this track is a jazz fusion of horn with a gritty drum beat underneath the free throw and commentary were a good touch to the album a well despite other artist using horrible interlude between their music the repitious use of the phrase who am i the emcee on the first song or track 3 the mc flowed well over the domingo produced east coast type beat just to prove a point is a live rock song that quiet during the hook and seem to fit in the equation kr one calculated on the sleeve it ha 18 track listed but there are actually 19 with step into a world rapture 's delight remix featuring p diddy and turned out to be a good club party song real hip hop part ii could have been done without mic vandalz and heartbeat could have been left completely out i got next is not quite the classic to get a five star rating but kr got a lot to offer on this one 

to be very honest this album is n't a bad a many ha perceived it to be the problem is that kr one ha made so many great album that when he drop one that doe n't hit those expectation people write it off i got next is a dope album in my opinion it ha it 's share off good and bad track all though out the album kr still ha the lyric but they 're not just hard hitting like his previous album and the production here is hit or miss some of the track completely lack replay value to a point that they are just forgettable a many old school fan those who cherishedcriminal minded by all mean necessary would question can kris keep up with artist in spring '97 or ha he fallen off keep in mind hip hop wa going through a major change around that time well kr is sort of hanging on with the time a said before he 's still have the flow but very little of his rhyme are quotable the production range from mid to late 90 's style and it sound pretty good here the showbiz produced a friend sound great production wise neva hadda gun is another good produced song by kris himself heartbeat wa sure to get the party started back in '97 the song feature redman and angie martinez who sound off beat just to prove a point is innovative but should never have been tried kr and rock just do n't mix a proven on that song a for the lyric their okay but could have been better for late 90 's standard over ya head is damn near over my head he said trust more than enough time in the third verse a good song would be the aforementioned neva hadda gun the mc is dope a well step into the world rapture 's delight is another great lyrical song there is a remix with puff daddy at the end of the album that is solid i also liked ca n't stop wo n't stop everything else on the album doe n't standout but are worth hearing for the most part this is really not a bad album in fact it 's much better than my expectation i recommend people to try not to remember previous kr one or boogie down production album while listening to this given that it could have been much better it still hold it 's own this is one of the few album on a major record label that wa n't a jiggy sounding a other release around that time although you can clearly tell jive record wa trying to push him in that direction which is one of the reason for the remix track at the end of the album it 's still worth owning but the trick is to not set the bar too high while listening peace lyric bproduction b guest appearance c musical vibe b top 5 track 1 i got next neva hadda gun2 ca n't stop wo n't stop3 step into a world rapture 's delight 4 the mc5 a friendhonorable mention 1 heartbeat featuring redman and angie martinez 2 blowe featuring redman 

the teacher blastmaster god of lyrical storm no one come to a battle like krsone doe all these young cat today can't come close to krsone he ha been rocking for over a decade too many style the originator of all rap gangsta reggae teach etc he get the most respect from other mc but doesn't sell record like some of these corny rapper but instead of platium record he gain platium respect he is the greatest of all time fresh for what ever year it is krsone 

this wa the best hip hop album i 've ever heard and what make me mad is that the legendary kr did n't get noticed because of his look but his lyrical talent is what should be noticed bacause by far he remains the greatest lyrical rapper ever and some other great lyrical rapper who do n't get noticed that much like keith murray mo def skee lo and dead prez should because they are the revolution of hip hop and if the game is interested in look more than talent then hip hop is dead but nontheless this is the man that inspired many known rapper today including ll cool j jay z na twista public enemy etc and in my point of view is the greatest rapper alive so if you like hip hop kr one fresh track and collaberations this album ha it all the legendary kr one will forever remain the greatest lyrical rapper in the world no one can reach his level 

i got next released in the spring of 1997 i got next wa the last studio lp from kr one on jive record the album wa a gold seller over 500 000 copy propelled largely by the single and video step into a world rapture 's delight the cd and cassette featured a puff daddy remix of the song that wa not released independently the gamble by jive worked and helped push sale of the album to help kr one earn his first gold plaque in several year other standout song include the showbiz produced a friend and heartbeat featuring redman angie martinez curiously dj premier kid capri and even the artist 's brother kenny parker are absent from the album a producer their presence is missed a a handful of song are sub par in impact the most surprising turn is near the end of the album just to prove a point where kr doe his first rap rock fusion song since 1988 's ya slippin' one is left wishing that a full album wa done like this interlude between song feature the artist 's spoken word poetry but did you expect any le from the blastmaster a re release of the album should include some remixes including one by former member of sublime 

this is the blast master at his absolute finest lyrically kr still had it and showed some of the best poetry and story telling skill that i have ever heard he just kept getting better and better a he progressed through the ninety but something happened towards the end of the millenium he kind of fell off musically then he fell off both musically and lyrically it a shame too because he is still the best live but he cant heat it anymore on solo record but this record is an often over looked classic in the world of hiphop it ha some of the greatest beat that i have ever heard and some of the dopest sleeve art i have ever seen on an album check it out seriously if you do not own this album and you call yourself hiphop you need to do some homework on the history of real hiphop my favorite track is cant stop wont stop the story telling line in that song are so vivid you almost feel like you are there you will not be dissapointed by this record if you choose to purchase it 

yo this wa the perfect album for kr at the time because people wa n't sure if he still had it in him after boom bap and kr one to me this wa the answer to boom bap i got next prooved he can rock a party like know one else the lyric are probably his best stylisticly the beat are tight and the guest appearences were on point too i know some were upset with the puffy remix of step into a world but i say why not kr rhymed with shabba rank back in the day so whats the difference meaning at the time shabba wa making it in the mainstream and no one had an issue with that so big deal it did n't diminish what wa acomplished on this album the only thing that wa missing wa a dj premier track or somethin close to it 

in my opinion this is kr best solo effort so far i ca n't skip no track from beginning to end this whole cd is pure form of the term real people can recognize a hip hop track like the mc step into a world or a friend are real classic such a the entire album this is a fresh air of hip hop which is mocked by fake gangsta like commercial freak like puffy nelly st lunatic or them c tr a h money what do you call them 's this is true hip hop if you a fake cat do n't buy this this is not meant for y'all but if you like true hip hop skill then buy it now 

but did you expect any le most blazing cut quot the mc quot produced by newcomer domingo quot a friend quot knocked out by showbiz quot hiphop quot featuring thor el rare promotional copy may include quot stop scheming quot featuring r amp b crooner joe quot step into a world quot is featured twice first in the jesse west version and then the ruff and ready remix featuring none other than puff daddy hear today 's top hitmaker trade line with the blastmaster also an experimental thrash cut quot just to prove a point quot doe just that kr can pretty much rock over any style that he chooses and personally i would absolutely love for him to do a whole rock album 

i got next wa good for the 90's even though i did not have it back then like i do now i've heard it it's ok to me friend is the one i like plus i still remeber the video 

what can i say it kr one of the greatest of all timeif you like kr or you dont know anything about him i would say there is no risk in getting this albumthe classic is defenitly step into a world which ha the nicest beatother great classic are the mc a friend and cant stop wont stopcheck it out 

p diddy should 've never be in a kr record i kinda felt like kr wa tryin to sell out wit diz album good track the mc a friend kr even did a rock track skip diz and get all his other album 

it 's sad that many people wo n't give mystikal a chance just 'cuz he 's stuck with the southern rap title this album is some of the most unique hip hop i 've heard but not in a lame artsy way it 's raw and real kinda like a southern busta rhyme take some off beat chopped and screwed jazz beat and add mystikal 's frantic outburst of lyric about weed and girl and you have a very unique album which never get boring 

the crescent city 's own mystikal release his third album and the first a a no limit soldier unpredictable wa surprisingly a stratigic move for establishing a name for himself immediately opening up embracing his position in the army with a salute on born 2 be a soldier featuring master p silkk the shocker fiend mac a ai n't no limit featuring silkk the shocker continuing to release his anger of his sister 's death on murder 2 a he confronts her killer a shine mourns her death with memory the production wa unlike any other no limit release going outside beat by the pound seeking the talent of rick rock for murder 2 paving the path to his career and time span on 13 year go into detail the title track contains a looped sample to emphasise the rapid tongue twisted hook highlighted the production by another outsider dj darryl being a product of the ghetto ghetto child featuring master p silkk the shocker is humbling experience of overcoming obstacle destined for those growing in that environment mystikal take excerpt and punchlines from some of his other song to create did i do it taking credit a the author we got the clout featuring mia x is a great duet speaking on their status without a hook and or chorus still is one of the most memerable tune of unpredictable explaining his addiction of smoking on still smokin' where smoker can relate to the event over the production by the legendary traxster that should have been extended to complete the session the hook alone express the feeling and content of the hook on u ca n't handle this because of his lyrical capability also evident on the man right chea showing his sexual prowness on d ck on the track go into a musical composition being conducted for comparison confession of infidelity on sleepin' with me featuring o'dell confronts his action of being in a relationship stepping up to classic new orleans bounce style it year give the album more depth a a near dance track incorporating mixing and scratching with a smooth swing and layered guitar complementing the slow groove of gangsta featuring snoop dogg master p completes the album effectiveness and overall feel mystikal 's unpredictable wa just a titled a his emphasis or lyrical delivery wa deemed necessary to agressively get the point across 

this is probably the tightest album too come out of the no limit camp his flowing is tighter than ever and the production is tight something that is rare in no limit project the only flaw on this are the unwanted occasional appearance by no limit couter part mystikal can definitely hold his own ground without them peace el 715 

think mystikal cant come out with a classic album but he did in 97 he ha an original style with the occassional outlashes of quick spit fire delivery unpredictable an aggressive style and a laid back style mystikal flow with ease his sound is natural and doesnt seemed forced the production on this album is ok but it is mystikals skill and charisma that save some song like quot 13 year quot here we go add some west coast flavor with e 40 and b legit and is the best song on the album still smokin is a nice chillin track the title track is his best display of his fast flow and it come off tight the man right chea is o h yes tight must give instrumental to me d on the track is a nice song also other tight song include did i do it aint no limit murder 2 exceptional cd pick it up 

the best album ever please this album is not even close to being good of the 17 song on here 2 are good about 6 are ok and the rest are just plain bad my least favorite no limit cd of the 15 or so i have clkose with snoop 's da game is to be sold album not even the no limit guest which oddly there are n't nearly a many a any other release can bring this up to even an ok album yeah mr puzzleface can rap fast but that do n't make him good his flow is way off beat and he ca n't rap either and the sad part is this is his best cd production is decent but not a good a beat by the pound crew usually is the wack rapper on the mic is probably the main reason craig b doe 6 song klc doe 5 o'dell doe 2 and rick rock dj darryl studio ton and legendary traxster all do 1 so when he asks did i do it i answer yes you made a horrible cd unless for some odd reason you 're one of the bunch of idiot who like him or comemrcial down south music save you money and ear drum on this one 1 8 f master p silkk the shocker fiend mac 2 7 about his murdered sister 3 6 4 6 5 7 f silkk the shocker 6 5 f master p silkk the shocker 7 4 8 5 f e 40 b legit master p 9 4 f mia x 10 7 5 11 6 5 12 8 5 nice beat 13 6 14 4 5 f o'dell 15 7 nice beat 16 5 5 f snoop dogg master p 17 7 deeper song michael tyler new orleans lacheck all my review 

man i 've never been so delighted with a south hip hop album like i am with this one i always thought the dirty south did n't deliver good hip hop untill i heard 'bout mystikal i loved his voice right away when i heard it i went out and searched for all his cd 's but the first 3 are n't available here so i went to england and picked them up there and i got to say it is worth it these cd are good his ruff voice and superfast flow ca n't be compaired to any other rapper you could say mystikal is one of a kind and them ol' dirty south beat on this joint are just smokin' it is an allmost flawless album i like every track from the first to the last but if i have to give the best track i would have to say damn i ca n't choose the whole cd 's great really you have to believe me it doe n't matter if you like east west north or south you 'll like this no matter what this is defenitly no limit at it 's best just buy it and find out 

this is a great album from the man right chea himself mystikal mystikal is tight and also hilarious with his crazy flippin lyric that work well with the tight beat on this cd the best song on here is here we go but most of the other song are tight a well including 13 year unpredictable ai n't no limit murder 2 which i think they messed the title up on it should be murderer 2 but oh well u ca n't handle this the man right chea d k on the track and sleepin with me this is an excellent cd from no limit so if yoou like no limit or if you just like mystikal or if you just like crazy hilarious lyric then check this album out today 

mystikal wa doing his thing with jive before no limit mind of mystikal wa great and i didnt think wa going to top that one until i heard this one the first track born 2 be a soldier wa slammin even though they could have kept silkk away from that song murder 2 pick up where murderer on the first album left off a mystikal let off some steam at his sister 's killer unpredictable 13 year u cant handle this the man right chea is mystikal at his best a usual mystikal always ha his smoke record on each album and still smokin' is the best one out of all of them d on the track and it yearns which sample t la rock 's it yours are mystikal flexing his lyrical muscle and he doe a good job too even though this album is tight it doe have it flaw silkk the shocker should have never been on aint no limit and born 2 be a soldier sleeping with me is kind of bland and gangsta feature snoop and master p wa soso the album end with a nice tribute to his sister which is called shine bottom line mystikal wa at his best on unpredictable which is his best album to date he wa hungrier here than he sound now and the production wa great this unquestionably one of the best no limit release standout track born 2 be a soldier murder 2 13 year unpredictable ghetto child here we go still smokin u cant handle this the man right chea d on the track and it yearns 

man this is a clean album born 2 be a soldier is the jam the man right chere is tight and pretty much the whole album mystikal is one of the hardest rapper on the tank he put the rap game on lockdown with this album he 's on fire no limit 2000 

quot unpredictable quot is maybe the best thing no limit ha ever released mystikal show why he is the most talented soldier on this well crafted sophmore album his first wa released on jive big boy there are many standout trax one of which is the title track on which mystikal spit that rapid fire stutter stop flow he 's mastered quot here we go quot is a nice collabo wit b legit amp e 40 while quot gangsta quot feature snoop on one of his first no limit appearance quot still smokin quot is his ode to those sticky green leaf while quot dick on the track quot feature some clever word play but the two stand out trax on here have to be quot the man right chea quot and quot shine quot quot the man right chea quot feature an unbelievable beat combined wit mystikal 's signature flow while quot shine quot is a touching tribute to his sister who wa murdered while he wa working on his first album quot born 2 be a soldier quot is yet another in what wa the long running quot soldier quot series of no limit trax not much to this one basically fast forward material but all in all the high point on this album far outweigh the low in my opinion this album is definitely a worthy buy 

mystikal is back and after signing with jive decides to join the no limit record team a well this sophmore release take no prisoner with a slicker and more enjoyable release from no limit includes appearences from the no limit rapper a well a the track quot here we go quot featuring e 40 b legit and master p also includes quot ain't no limit quot featuring silkk the shocker and master p and snoop dogg 's first appearence on the label quot gangsta quot also featuring master p 

this is mystikal 's 1st lp 4 no limit he ha another on big boy record this cd is hott the rhyme the beat it like no limit and mystikal were ment to be together mystikal is the man right chea this screaming man on the tank express his feeling 4 the man who killed his sister and just out right rapping also the man can free stlye he show his talent on here we go with here we go also on this cd you can find rhyme by master p silkk the shocher b legit e 40 snopp dogg and the flow of o'dell but the song that is off the hook is stil smokin' a song which is he ha continued off his 1st cd all i can say is that no limit is in the spot light with this man he is the most popular man on no limit pick up the cd and you will feel the flow of the man they call mystikal 

just like every 2pac it sold a one of the best cd ever well this is a awesome cd a must have this is a classic and if u do n't have it then i think u should get it soon 

this wa my least favorite 2pac album that doesnt mean it wasnt good it wa but i thought it wa a dissappointment some of the song were pretty whack there were a lot of song that i really liked disc 1 contained most of the good song like open fire r u still down where do we go from here i wonder if heaven got a ghetto nothng 2 lose and my favorite on disc 1 hellrazor that song wa deep and real disc 2 song were pretty bad with the exception of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto remix when i get free ii enemy with me ready 4 whatever and my favorite only fear of death i think i would have been better if 2pac hadnt of changed his voice like that when i first bought it i listened to it for about a week then i went back listening to other 2pac cd overall i think afeni shakur did a poor job producing the album i think if suge knight had produced it with her it would have been a lot better by 2pacs 1 fan 

if any one ever asks you what poetry mean tell them to buy this album all the song are tight even though pac wrote song within 5mins and the beat he went over were not great just go to show what talent he had clasic song are nuttin to loose open fire and only fear is death go buy it 

a nother great cd by pac which got his best track ever i wonder if heaven got a gheto and other great track like open fire when i get free 2 and do for luv go get this cd r i p tupac 

your purchase should be based entirely on the question asked in the title of the album itself are you still down there have been a lot of album released after tupac 's death and beginning with r u still down it is easy to tell that quality original 2pac material is becoming hard to come by tupac wa immensely paranoid about his own death and wa absolutely convinced he wa destined to die an early tragic death because of the paranoia he recorded a many song a he could it is amazing there have been so many cd released after his death but it is easy to tell that sug and death row are running out of quality material with that said i still think this is a great album r u still down is very catchy hellrazr is an incredibly powerful narrative and of course there is i wonder if heaven got a ghetto which i think is one of the best song 2pac ever created the first cd is great and show pac at some of his best but the second cd is not nearly a good and really start to drag at the later half you know it is bad when they have to double up song too i wonder if heave got a ghetto reappears on the second cd and is a so so remix at best overall you just have to ask yourself am i still down if you ca n't get enough 2pac go right ahead and buy this album you 'll likely not be disappointed however if you are starting to lose interest this cd may not be worth the money especially since the second cd is only mediocre and finally if you are new to tupac me against the world all eyez on me and his greatest hit cd are better starting point 

r u still down is a must have for pac fan i love every track on here expect for one but it ok but dont really care 4 it disc 11 remeption 7 10 good intro2 open fire 10 10 hot raging lyrics3 r u still down 9 10 good tune4 hellrazor 10 10 outdid himself wit this one5 thug style 8 10 great beginning6 where do we go from here 7 5 10 deep interlude7 i wonder if heaven got a ghetto remix 10 10 i love it8 nothing to lose 10 10 classic9 i'm getting money 9 10 close 2 classic10 lie to kick it 5 10 dont really care 4 it just another play these hoez type song11 f k all y'all 10 10 tight beat12 let them thangs g0 8 5 10 nice fast song13 definition of a thug n a 8 10 good production by dj quikdisc 21 ready 4 whatever 9 10 big skye pac r great 2gether2 when i get free 10 10 a lot different from his other joints3 hold on be strong 9 10 tight4 i'm losin' it 9 10 pac have same lyric from the song pain 5 fake a b s 7 5 10 sometimes get annoying6 do for love 10 10 2nd single from the cd classic7 enemy wit me 8 5 10 didnt like at first but began likin it8 nothing but love 10 10 another classic9 16 on death row 9 10 slow but nice10 i wonder if heaven got a ghetto 9 10 good but i like remix better 1st single of cd11 when i get free ii 10 10 get me hyped when i hear this classic12 black starry night 8 10 this is a weird interlude but still listenable13 only fear of death 10 10 favorite song on both disc this n a had heart when he recorded this still good eventhough remixed 

following the untimely and tragic death of musical genius and rap icon tupac shakur his mother afeni saw to it that she and his estate attained the right to his musical legacy including some of the lost and forgotten outtake from his early album like quot strictly 4 my n i g g a z quot and quot thug life quot such album leftover seem to be the highlight of this beefed up but dated double album most of the track on this album were clearly recorded between 1992 and 1994 before his incarceration and his infamous day on death row record there are some very powerful track like quot hellrazor quot and the moving quot do 4 love quot but spreading it out over two disc hurt the overall feel of it pac 's question of self worth on quot wonder if heaven got a ghetto quot also do a good job of showcasing shakur the poet but there is no need for two version of the same song when one got the job done just fine aside from these highlight most of this two disc album sound exactly the same more work could have been done to update the beat and make the track stand out more on their own all that really remains in the average listener 's mind when he think of the majority of music on quot r u still down quot is the raspy and tired sounding voice of shakur echoing through the speaker a much a many fan criticize later posthomous release for depending too much on sample and r amp b type production a little of that might have actually helped this particular release i'm not suggesting that the whole album sound that way but a few track could have stood to be polished a bit all in all quot r u still down quot is a very raw and rugged souding album a much a i wanted to get into a lot of the track on this album the production wa just so simple that it made many of them sound exactly the same for those who might not know much of the production ha been changed but the record still feel rushed the finished result is a double album that could have been cut down considerably but is still worth the price of admission for any true pac fan 

this album ha a lot of gem and hidden jewel showcasing some of pac 's greatest material it is obvious that 2pac wa in a zone when he wa making these song you can just feel his energy a he rap non stop from verse to hook to verse to hook a he doe on most of the song on this album this collection wa put together after 2pac died so it 's more of a collection of song than an album per se but there wa something unique about pac 's spirit when making most of these song that provides a cohesive force of sort that make it all fit together well it seems a if pac wa just hitting his stride and really getting comfortable in the studio during these session and the result are song that sound really fresh and honest even when they are not his greatest material the first nine track are outstanding and add a very critical element to the big picture of who 2pac wa a an artist 'open fire' is just intense and relentless the title track is much more personal and comtemplative it resonates most strongly when 2pac feeling battered and persecuted say now the whole world 's callin' me a killer all i ever did wa try to reach the kid with the real la and this doe honestly seem to be quite true of 2pac 's intention up until the point where he made the material on this album i never truly understood some of the criticism that he faced this is pretty much the tone of the next five song and they are all some of the best song that he ha ever written especially 'hell razor' this is something that you just have to hear to appreciate 2pac basically just blindly let it go honestly pleading and screaming his heart and soul out i'm gettin money is another winner and like to kick it is also a pretty solid effort the next two song sound like nothing more than studio exercise and should have been left off of the album the last track on the first disc is quite similar to i'm gettin money and is also quite powerful the second disc doe not have any really bad song but it is not a good a the first one because it only ha a few song that stand out a really great the song on the second disc that stand out most to me are hold on be strong do for love nothin but love finding 2pac at his most compassionate and idealistic saying i help an old lady across the street the cost is free i ca n't take what she offer me this is how the world could be this is how the world should be i wonder if heaven got a ghetto when i get free ii and the haunting only fear of death this is not exactly 2pac 's best album but it is one of his most enjoyable to just ride out and listen to it also give you a clearer and much more well rounded picture of who 2pac wa than the solid but seriously overrated all eyez on me so i would strongly recommend it to anyone who want to see more of 2pac than what the mainstream is accustomed to 

tupac shakur 's r u still down remember me came out in 1997 one year after his passing production could of been better on this album but lyric and 26 track definetly make it an album for the collection if your a pac fan nice track on disc one include the title track r u still down hellrazor a powerfull track with sick beat a an angry pac lay down memorable lyric i wonder if heaven got a ghetto is an upbeat track where pac talk about growing up making money and thug life nothing to lose is another ill track pac verse walk a mile in my shoe and you would be crazy too im getting money and other song close off disc one well disc 2 come next third track hold on be strong is an upbeat track sort of like keep ya head up do for love feat eric williams of blackstreet is a deep and memorable track about love 16 on death row is a powerfull harcore track when i get free ii and only fear of death are both nice track and close off the album well r u still down is really an album dedicated to thug life and pac come across powerfully he le poetic and le philosophical on this album then previous and later release this album is gangster rap at it best what make some of the later post death album untill the end of time better dayz better in my opinion is they cover the time period 1994 1996 right before his death while this album cover music from 1991 1994 period when he wa still progressing a an artist r u still down may not be for everyone but if you love pac like i do you will appreciate this album 

this album is only for real tupac fan that pay attention to lyric a well a the beat while some of the beat were off pac 's voice shined alongside with his lyrical skill this album ha song taken from when he wa a teen which is why some people might not feel him but that 's cool because tupac wa all about keeping it real and if you do n't feel this album then you are n't real no i am not implying that you have to like it but you ca n't call it wack even if you did n't appreciate his work for people to sit there and say pac wa pretty weak on this album is like saying michael jordan wa wack back in his college day of hoop my point being is you ca n't compare pac then and now of course he 's different now he 's matured even moreso in all i do believe that real pac fan will love this album because it display pac 's lyrical versitility from way back in the day peacemic 12 

this album is decent by no mean his best work but it still ha a fair amount of song that can easily be concidered classic material i dont think that it is a concistent a his previous release like all eyez on me and me against the world but is stilla great listen with few weak track the best song are a followshell razordo for lovei wonder if heaven got a ghettolie to kick it 

there are two 2pac album who rock all eyez on me and r u still down remeber me this album is super great each song ha it own image he own topic which mean tupac had heart for everything he wa a really great person i am an artist on my starting way and i'm from israel so i learnand get idea for song from pac he rock everything i love this album in peticular b cu of the song they still talk for real so buy this a fast a you can if you like tupac 

these are 26 cut recording from tupac 's earlier day taken from the year of 91' through to 94' a long listen but at the end you end up realising what a great loss of talent the world of hip hop suffered when the thug rapper wa tragically gunned down back in 1996 although these are song that did n't make it to his earlier album this did not doubt my opinion of their quality it wa good material although not consistent enough this is more of a black and white album with no shade of gray the good song are great the bad song are terrible 'r u still down ' doe have it hot spot with track such a the unforgettable 'do for love' the religious 'i wonder if heaven gotta ghetto' and the haunting and very mysterious 'only fear of death' lyrically at this stage of his life especially tupac 's view are more political and intellectual for the majority of the album since he had not quite reached his death row day just yet the two disc set in a way tell a story of a man who wa on the verge of something here yet never got the time to fulfil it a you can tell some verse are incomplete and hesitant do not think this lessens the album quality a about 80 of it is worth while although one of my favourite tupac album 'r u still down ' in short is a sad and depressing story of a man who knew his end wa to come far too soon 

this double disc released after his death contains material from 92 95 before his death row day it ha some good song and no real weak one on here feature some of his old homies big syke spice 1 outlawz but it 's mostly just 2pac ha a few classic joint and is a definite for all fan it 's good afeni suge did n't mess w the beat and guest like they did on all the rest of his post humous material production is by edi soulshock did 3 each tony pizzaro 2pac live squad warren g johnny j each did 2 and akshun qdiii mike mosely ricky rouse choo rasser dj darryl 2pac all did 1 it ha 3 classic 3 or 4 almost classic 1 ok song and the rest are good a must have rap album for all disc 1 2 8 5 3 8 4 9 f val young 5 8 7 8 8 8 5 9 8 10 9 5 f richie rich talking 'bout how to spit game get some 11 8 5 laid back track 12 9 13 9disc 2 1 10 classic f big syke 2 7 3 8 4 8 f big syke spice 1 almost same verse spice ha on tale from the hood sndtk 5 9 6 8 5 slower song f blackstreet 7 8 f kadafi r i p kastro napoleon edi amin dramacydal or outlawz 8 9 5 9 8 5 10 8 same a 7 on disc 1 11 10 classic 13 10 very deep song and a classic one of my favorite 2pac song tupac amaru shakur b 6 16 71 d 9 13 96check all my review 

i would like to also point out to you that i have a broad taste in hip hop i do also like many of the rapper you point to a do many tupac fan so maybe it is you that is ignorant biggie ha an amazing flow but his lyric are average and he never really rap about anything meaningful na is in my opinion the greatest lyricist ever i love nwa a well but none of them had the charisma and presence tupac had a for him contradicting himself you do n't think he noticed that everyone contradicts themselves he wa n't afraid to show it either because he said what wa on his mind at the time have you ever listened to his lyric he genuinely believed that woman should be treated with respect yet on the other hand it conflicted with the one night stand he had listen to temptation on me against the world he wa the realest to ever pick up the mic and not just that he wa also a well above average lyricist anyone who say otherwise is talking s t buy me against the world and listen to him at his lyrical peak he wa not wack i can only assume that you attack him because of what he said to biggie get over it the beef died when they both died it wa 9 year ago i feel sorry for people like you who ca n't appreciate both of their music this album is n't his best but is still a good one but need some work r i p 2pac 

i'm surprised how this album ha been accepted let not get carried away with his legacy and his tragic death and all the controversy surrounding 2pac everybody already know about all that r u still down is my favorite album by 2pac makaveli and all eyez are both 5 star to me but r u still down is more raw especially a far a the production is concerned a lot of people are apparently disappointed by the production on this album i find it to have a sense of being more genuine and more fitting than the other posthumous release this is probably since pac actually had some input on creating these track overall the sound of the album and individual track is more whole listening to r u still down help to show how much of a project makaveli and all eyez on me were those two album were obviously much more orchestrated and calculated and designed to provoke in every way they were much more surgical and precise r u still down however is just straight hip hop there 's scratching on here there 's no name dropping or dis aimed at specific people just general expression of different emotion instead of a song about tipper gore or bad boy for example specificly you get the more general and undated song about the struggle in general with government oppression or social commentary or anger or whatever this is technically easier for a listener to relate to since hardly any of u actually know tipper gore or puffy etc but somehow the audience doe n't want that wtf thug style is probably the single song by pac to most adhere to the street chronicling and nostalgic waxing scenario in hip hop and at the same time he 's replying directly to everybody giving this album bad review 'you do n't know my style 'just because all eyez sounded one way or makaveli sounded one way or strictly 4 my sounded one way do n't get it twisted it art you gotta be open do n't expect artist to be how you want them to be you cannot expect anything from art all that doe is turn it into a product instead of art the lyric on this album are of thing more accesible to the common listener the production is reminiscent of earlier 2pac and more of a east coast style of the early 90 's pre death row there 's more lyrical acrobatics than usual let them thangs go and more of the same techincal lie to kick it and simple format f all y'all we 're used to from 2pac if you ignore all the hype and controversy surrounding the artist and drop your expectation of him just listen to the music on r u still down for the music then maybe you can re discover the best mc with this album 

prolly best album next 2 all eyez on me and the 7 day theorymy favorite junts is fake as bitch hold on be strong hellrazor and losin it 

this album is good but not pac 's best this album is probably worth getting it 's the kind of album that some people like and some people do n't 

tupac 's mother did a great work on putting this cd together most of this material are unreleased song from around 1994 for the people that are really down with mr makaveli you must own this item it highlight a phase of tupac 's life quot hellrazor quot listen and learn 

great tape r u still remember me some unreleased material eerie sad happy everything is on there the good the bad and da' ugly good album would recommend 

this album ok i got it day it wa out cuz i wa a pac fan before he died unlike 60 of his fan now but this wa the best album that wa released after he died i love hold on be strong when i get free 2 ill track right there im sick of these new cd tho they should just stop i mean trick daddy and pac i like trick but damn better dayz wa well the only good track were the outlawz track 

this is one of my more favorite cd that came out after his death it`s great and a the rest of them to follow a well 

came out in 1997 the record were recorded during the year around strictly time i did n't get this until last year because i could n't find it anywhere and it took me a while to grow up on it and after all these month i finally did since it came out in 1997 it leaf me asking the question why it release were never featured on 2pac 's greatest hit album after all the release he released were all great track and deserved to be on his greatest hit album many people did n't like this track because it sounded different from all of 2pac 's other work but to me it sounded like the work 2pac would usually do just in his younger day this cd provides many great unreleased track that are groovy to listen and dance to and ha the most party track i 've seen 2pac release on an album some of my classic on this are hellrazor i wonder if heaven got a ghetto nothing to lose the best song on the cd lie to kick it hold on be strong fake as bithes do for love nothin but love when i get free ii and only fear of death i would recommend this to true 2pac fan a it will take a while to grow on it since it the present not the past many people do n't really like listening to old music now but i find i enjoy it but it is definately worth a listen peace to rap 's finest rapper r i p 

it really suck with mr shakur long gone no politics in hip hop rap shakur wa a better activist than public enemy or cube the true thug 'd out outlaw it also suck with eazy big poppa being gone aswell i would like to also point out to you that i have a broad taste in hip hop i do also like many of the rapper you point to a do many tupac fan so maybe it is you that is ignorant biggie ha an amazing flow but his lyric are average and he never really rap about anything meaningful na is in my opinion the greatest lyricist ever i love nwa a well but none of them had the charisma and presence tupac had a for him contradicting himself you do n't think he noticed that everyone contradicts themselves he wa n't afraid to show it either because he said what wa on his mind at the time have you ever listened to his lyric he genuinely believed that woman should be treated with respect yet on the other hand it conflicted with the one night stand he had listen to temptation on me against the world he wa the realest to ever pick up the mic and not just that he wa also a well above average lyricist anyone who say otherwise is talking s t buy me against the world and listen to him at his lyrical peak he wa not wack i can only assume that you attack him because of what he said to biggie get over it the beef died when they both died it wa 10 year ago i feel sorry for people like you who ca n't appreciate both of their music this album is n't his best but is still a good one but need some work the joint open fire featuring scarface is a heavy hitting joint by our beloved pac hellrazor featuring stretch val young is another tight joint about stress in the project sparking up dub nothin' but love featuring dave hollister is a tight block party bay area song about drinking hennessey smoking on some dope hustlin' my very favorite when i get free ii featuring outlawz is a phat joint thats just krazy ha the best beat shakur 's greatest joint 4 disc 1 are 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 shakur 's greatest joint 4 disc 2 are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 13 oh yeah r i p 

after the 7 day theory wa r u still down this 26 track albumwas hard but a diffrence side of pac came out on i wonder if hip hopgot ghetto it still a great album 

this cd is a sad reminder of 2pac 's music but luckily they put album together to share the greatest rapper's music with u that wa never released r u still down ha many good song also like open fire r u still down hellrazor thug style where do we go from here interlude i wonder if heaven got a ghetto do 4 love only fear of death when i get free iii advise you buy this cd evn though it's harder to find now good cd 

this album came out after 2pacs death i believe they are unreleased track their some pretty good track on this double disc album it 's best to get this album to add to your cd collection 

those of you who are expecting another best of all time 2 cd album from 2pac will be sorely disappointed this album is nowhere near a good a the aforementioned all eyez on me of course you ca n't really expect too much since the man had been dead about 2 year when this album came out the first cd is pretty decent i can make it through most of the song without any serious complaint some of the better song include quot i wonder if heaven got a ghetto quot not the one you heard one the radio quot thug style quot and quot nothing to lose quot the second cd fall terribly short though about the only song i like listening to is quot do for love quot and you could 've just recorded that off the radio or bet if it were just the first cd this album might get 4 star but a it is it 's lucky it get 3 those of you who are expecting vintage pac i e before his death do n't waste your time on this album those of you who just have to have more pac well go ahead and get this it 's not completely terrible but it 's not that good 

i read some review where people said it wa rushed tupac wrote these song before he died these song were never altered sold poluted or reprised by any other producer artist eminem never got a chance to add his voice or 50 cent 's to a song or album i believed it wa somewhat of a cry from the grave or in a sense final word to poet and fan alike who could benifet from his wisdom this album is not be appreciated for it abilty to entertain a club or crowd and not all rap album arent supposed to i believe this album to be the true voice of tupac after his grave it is familier of his me against the world album i urger anyone who is looking for a cd to bump in their car play at a party or while cleaning their house to not buy thus album but anyone who want to know what tupacs real future for his music to do so please let not poision his legacy let uphold it 

ru still down first posthumus 2pac album is my favorite one created after he died pac vocal are not sped up and the production sound like a 2pac album i could list this whole album a the best song but the standouts to me are ru still down hellrazor wonder if heaven got a ghetto hip hop version open fire when i get free 1 and 2 do for love f all yall well just forget it every song on here is a standout in my eye pac 's album would go downhill from here 

2pac is the most lyrical and heartful rapper i have ever listen to they have amaru record still going strong with 8 released 2pac cd since his death this one is another classic with my favorite song like open fire r u still down remember me hellrazor i wonder if heaven got a ghetto and definition of a thug n well im gonna stop boring the crap out of you all this just show you how good and kick as this cd is in my opinion if ya want a 2pac cd that ha come out after his death this and the 7 day theory is the one you want peace out rip 2pac amaru shakur 

any true pac 's fan will love this album in the first time hear it is hard for me to decided which one of the cd 's is the best cuz both of them are great but the one thing for sure is this album is my third favourite after me againts theworld all eye on me although most of the song in this album are remixes but they are still great might be the reason for this is because the original version is too sloppy so that 's why it never appeared in the previous album and if it 's so then this album is true definition of lost tape unlike the others pac 's posthomous album this one is far from commercial approach you do n't have to worry about the new beat because it 's still carrying the sound of pac 's album before the death row year we should give a big prop to ricky rouse who make a magic touch for the most of song with his excellent guitar play which not only great complement for the song but also turn pac 's lyric into vivid picture that you can see clearly like movie on the big screen if you already have me againts the world all eye on me you must have this album or if you wanna start hearing pac this is not bad choice 

though this album wa rushed out after the sucess of the makeveli album it still contains some gem on it unfortunately the production lack there of is average at best disc one start off nice with open fire r u still down and hellrazor which is a headnodder and lyrically tight i like both version of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto but prefer disc 2 's version slightly better w brownstone singing backround nothing to lose is definitely the best track on disc one that track along w hellrazor is typical 2pac at his best the next three track on disc one however needed better production period i loved the fact that they added definition of a thug nigga which wa previously only available only on the poetic justice soundtrack which is one of pac 's hardest joint disc 2 do for love and the hip hop version of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto were the chosen single to be released for radio the obvious bangin track is the reggae flavored when i get free pt 1 which is the slamminest track on there take me back to a soldier story pt 1 day too bad it is n't actually pac 's voice on there rappin but the track is hot nonetheless 16 on death row is typical politcal pac w a hidden message of course when i get free pt 2 wa okay but compared to the first version on the same side it 's no comparison and only fear of death end the disc 2 nicely the song almost give you an insight into pac 's state of mind before his death this album had the potential to do much better with better production but pac 's song like always seems to supercede even weak production 

finally tupac shakur ha came down from cloud 9 only this ha happened after tupac shakur ha actually visited cloud 9 heaven this double lp sound more like a compilation of 2pac 's early work most track were made around the time of 2pacalypse now and strictly 4 my n i g g a z and it show although tupac a always come with it lyrically for the most part this album like his old album suffers from poor production but this lp is still a solid buy it is just below average overall a an lp record like do 4 me and i wonder if heaven got a ghetto remix alone are an overwhleming excuse to buy this album 

2pac 's best album i love his music and this album is a classic combining gansgta rap to his angry voice buy this one if u r a big fan of 2pac also reminds of good time with biggie b i g i tried to get it from different store when it came out but this album wa always out of stock finally i got it along time ago and it is still in my cd player never got out from there for me this is the best rap album ever and also 2pac 's greatest work 

it 's very much a patchwork but i like the whole thing there 's alot of those various voice pac used to play with and there different type of beat that are mostly good some dj quik one with the wind parade sample that black moon used for buckemdown and then a bunch of beat by some group of guy that use a lot of guitar but i like them 16 on death row when i get free wonder if heaven got a ghetto etc 'typical' pac fare in one way lot about dying but there 's also a variety of differen phase some of that real melodramatic brenda got a baby type stuff before he perfected his drama both cd are really good to listen to even if there 's no real hit 

r u still down is one of the best after life 2pac album that anyone ha put together it is a hard listener but the overall talent that he must have put into making that much material before he died deserves enough respect but overall r u still down is a must have 

i do agree with a earlier reveiw that the first disk is verry good if they took do for love ready 4 whatever and the second version of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto along with loosing my mind when i get free and the interlude and cramed the in the first cd this would actually be a tight cd but it still deserves 4 star even though it not a single disc 

first of all ive got to say that cd1 is'nt better than cd2 but overall this album is not that bad not the best 2pac album of course for several reason it wa released in 1997 but the song are from 1994 some of the song lacked what id expect of him i liked do 4 luv and hellrazor when i get free2 hold on and some others but this album ha some really good beat and tune get it but dont be to disa pointed about some of it 

why do amazon randomly delete review there wa nothing wrong with my previous review and in fact the guy above me actually used a whole paragraph of my old review for himself this is the best compilation of posthumous tupac song there are some serious classic on here how some of these missed the cut for strictly 4 my nig az and 2pacalypse now i do n't know my favourite include the title track i wonder if heaven got a ghetto with the verse they recycled for change hold on be strong do for love fake a s bit he hellrazor lie to kick it etc probably the track he go deepest on is only fear of death which is another eerie track in which pac predicts his early death this album is nothing like his other posthumous release the beat are a he intended and most importantly no one ha messed around with his lyric eminem he may not have considered these track to be worthy of release when alive but there are still many gem on here highly recommended 

well this is not quite the best tupac album ever im not saying it bad im just saying compared to album he ha put out in the past for example 65533 all eyez on me 65533 and 65533 me against the world 65533 this album is not a good ru still down feature two disk but one must say that if they had just added the best song onto one disk this album would have been better for me standout track on this album are first off from disk 1 open fire the title track r u still down remember me i wonder if heaven got a ghetto and to be honest i can only pick out one good song from disk 2 which is do for love it not really a good example of what tupac wa really about the beat are lame at time and don 65533 t really appreciate tupac 65533 s lyrical capability saying that this album is way better than some album other artist have been releasing and one the reason i am a bit disappointed with this album is because of the quality of past project it really doe give you the idea that someone ha just put these song together and hope they will please fan because tupac is singing it if someone picked up this album and had not heard of tupac before this moment they wouldn 65533 t think much of it and it would be left picking up dust if you really love tupac you should get this album but personally if i were you i would try to find someone that ha it and just borrow it off them for a few day a bit disappointing 

before i begin i 'd like to state something everyone ha a right to say what they feel it 's the first ammendment of the constitution numero uno why should these guy be denied that right simply because they have a problem with the system ok we 'll change the ammendment to quot freedom of religion speech press and assembly unless you talk smack about the wretched current shape of thing seriously that ammendment let you right these review you 're exercising the right you think they should be denied if all you do is rant about them being quot unamerican quot that having been said this is a very good cd when i first got it i wa n't too crazy about it the vocal did n't really hit largely because i could n't understand them and i would go off and listen to something else for a while after i had gotten thru this cd a few time though it really started to grow on me and it 's becoming one of my favorite punk album sure it get a bit repetitive and i do n't like how they dis davey havock from afi quot davey destroyed the punk scene quot but the musical quality overall is just awesome if you 're a brainwashed propaganda spouting conservative then no this album is not for you but if you like well done music with a purpose then pick this up the best track are quot you 've got to die for the government quot quot rotten future quot and quot f police brutality quot 

this is the first anti flag album and i didnt like it at first but it quickly grew on me this album is le accessable than their current work but still great anti flag are your classic anti authoritarian anti patriotism etc punk band their main influence being the sex pistol and the uk sub they create brilliant album the highlight here is really the title track you 've got to die for your government which is an ironic attack on the government reminiscent of the sex pistols' god save the queen and the dead kennedys' kill the poor among others i know a lot of people dont like them because they are getting really popular but so what just because most of their audience are poser doesnt make the message any le valid or the music any le great and to all those patriotic idiot lol maybe one day you 'll wake up probably not though 

okay in response to a few people while anti flag may not be revolutionary being revolutionary in an age where almost every formula ha been tried is a difficult thing to do what they are however is a very thought provoking band and what 's so wrong with getting people to think secondly this is not a band for those who got into punk via blink 182 i 've been listening to punk rock since i wa 14 initially with sex pistol bootleg like quot we 've cum for your child quot eventually moving on to the clash 's earlier work minor threat dead kennedy d i and a slew of other old school band now six year later i embrace the philosophy put forth by anti flag these guy are doing today what dk did in the '80s and the reason to buy this cd is not because you hate america buy this cd because you love the american people and because you 're sick to death of seeing them mistreated and slaughtered by their own government 

i personally like their newer stuff better because they christened their sound over time and justin 's voice got better but he ha always been a political genius and it show here a much a in any other album the lyric are incredible in almost every song but the best song are you 'd do the same die for the government red white and brainwashed f police brutality and my personal favorite punk by the book also drink drank punk is a funny one and she 's my little go go dancer is a good song but the lyric are kind of dumb most of the other song are also good for a listen except for a few like your daddy wa a rich man your daddy 's f ing dead which to me just get annoying overall this is a great punk album but i personally prefer album such a underground network and the terror state 

anti flag is one of the few truly punk core band that are still running these day and this is one of their greatest album maybe the greatest af album of all time that for sure suckas and you can find them in fat wreck chord byo and a bunch of independent label out there mija so buy it or steal it from a punk guy who often like to forget stuff 

this band is truly terrible first off the music is terrible it 's soft and wimpy and lack any musical credibility i'm not just saying this because i hate punk i do n't see how anyone can like this the singer or singer have no excuse to be singing do n't believe me check out quot daddy wa a rich man quot or pretty much any of their song the lyric are so ridiculous i appreciate anti political manifesto very much the reason they are ridiculous is because they could n't have made it more obvious that they do n't know what they 're talking about all they do is whine what 's the matter guy did n't mommy and daddy give you whatever you wanted they would n't let you take the car out last night what a joke a is all punk rock with the exception of a select few who decide to rise above the punk cliche you want angry music with actual talent listen to metal 

punk ha had a long and proud tradition of being involved in left wing radical politics however the best punk band were n't just about the preachy lyric they combined the polemic with a distinctive and memorable sound joe strummer of the clash knew this a did jello biafra dead kennedy and d boon and mike watt minuteman anti flag apparently doe n't realize this these guy hang their hat on their quot radical quot lyric and not much else note that many punk and metal band prior to anti flag were spewing similar political invective with far more wit flair and intelligence than this band 's ham handed juvenile anthem it doe n't help anti flag 's case that they frequently approach open hypocrisy case in point anti flag claim to be anti violence riiiight with song titled quot kill the rich quot how am i supposed to take this swill seriously moreover the music is just godawful yes i realize punk is supposed to be amateurish but this is plain terrible not to mention about a quot edgy quot a a teddy bear i 've heard junior high school nofx ripoffs play better than this anti flag apparently ha two singer but both suck equally and the band sound about a instrumentally proficient a i am not very in summary anti flag is another batch of inept fashion quot punk quot regurgitating the same ol' protest and trying to pas them off a quot rebellious quot sorry i'm not falling for it spend your lawn mowing money wisely kid and pick up record by the clash dead kennedy black flag bad brain minuteman wire mc5 etc your listening will be all the better for it 

i love this band they get better and better finally a new school band with a good messege amazing 

those are the word that describe this legendary and often disputed punk band alot of people accuse these guy of being non patriotic but the fact of the matter is these guy want change and they are willing to fight for it die for the government reminds me alot of the sex poseur 1st release except these guy actually write there own stuff 1 youd do the same 5 52 youe got to die for the government 6 53 drink drank punk 5 54 rotten figure 5 55 safe tonight 4 56 red white and brainwashed 6 57 dayed destroyed the punk scene 6 58 summer squatter go home 5 59 shes my little go go dancer 4 510 police state in the usa 5 511 punk by hate book 5 512 f police brutality 5 513 im being watched by the cia 5 514 kill the rich 5 515 no more dead 4 516 confused youth 5 517 your daddy wa a rich man your daddy f ing dead 5 5this is an excellent cd which one can listen to all the way through no skipping track here no this is a gold mine of pure punk adrenaline this is definately worth your time and money and i strongly recomend purchasing this incredible cd by this incredible punk band all hail anti flag 

with this ten dollar cd purchase i replaced the import vinyl version i purchased back in the 70 for basically the same amount of dough five leaf left is probably one of the best debut album anyone 's ever produced there 's a list i need to make and nearly four decade after it wa released it sound amazingly fresh cello song when the day is done man in a shed i could rave about individual song but the truth is there 's not a clunker in the bunch a lot of cd collection have been compiled of drake 's music with added outtake demo and such i think the best way to listen to five leaf left and bryter layter are to listen to the song in the order that they were originally presented a lot of musician cite drake a an influence but his vocal phrasing poetic lyric and odd guitar tuning make his music like no other i 've ever heard some find his music depressing i find it like a rainy sunday afternoon melancholy but much needed for growth 

in my opinion five leaf left wa nick drake 's best effort a far a attaining a balance between the arrangement of his song in the studio and his guitar playing whereas his song on bryter layter were suffocated by overproduction and orchestration and pink moon wa notoriously underproduced five leaf left ha just the right balance between accompaniment and his great guitar work song like three hour have percussion that doe n't interfere with or bury nick 's guitar in the mix allowing the listener to check out his amazing fingerpicking technique the song are really strong too song like saturday sun an example of nick drake 's rarely heard piano playing have such great melody that they stick with you this album also includes the eerily prophetic fruit tree which could serve a a fitting epitaph for nick drake himself in it he sings about being out of step with the time he wa in and eventually achieving fame and appreciation after death which is exactly what happened to him the haunting last line they 'll stop and stare when you 're gone is chilling the title of the album refers to a saying on the box of the brand of cigarette nick smoked but it ha also been noted that nick died five year after the release of this album in 1969 like the song fruit tree this coincidence make you wonder it 's amazing that nick drake wa 21 year old when this album wa recorded and he already displayed such talent on the guitar it 's also amazing that he wrote these song at such a young age i would recommend this album to anyone regardless of what their musical taste are there is something about nick drake 's music that stay with you long after you hear it 

nick drake came on the folk scene at a time where most folkies wrote song inspired by blue and country just a much a traditional music drake however did the unthinkable by mixing jazz and even classical influence with his music his guitar playing here is strong actually quite technical at time and it wonderfully backed up by string piano and various other instrument this is progressive folk much like progressive rock it combine it sound with music not normally associated with that particular genre in this case classical chamber and jazz this is in direct opposition to the country and blue based music of bob dylan and such for this reason this album doe not sound very dated at all in fact it could have been released today in the 70 the 90 ect psychedelic rock and acid rock are so rooted in the 60 they now sound like artifact of that era where a this music which resisted the norm of the time sound just a fresh a when it wa first released even though the lyric do n't seem to be personal when you listen to them the music say otherwise the album ha a very somber atmosphere most likely associated with nick drake 's condition it 's well known that he died from a pill overdose and some even think it wa a suicide he only released a few album but all of them reveal a tortured mind expressing itself the best way it could through music please be advised that this is not a folk album in the traditional sense it is n't even a folk rock album nothing rock hard here it doe n't need to in a way this music is just a advanced a most progressive rock if you 're willing to take a chance on a very unique sounding album then this is a great purchase 

there are four nick drake album and i think that this is probably his best work though they are all wonderful a lot of hook will leave this one in your cd player from the opener quot time ha told me quot the music is irresistable that song ha great lyric perhaps somewhat fortelling of his untimely death quot time ha told me not to ask for more because someday our ocean will find the shore quot it 's lyric like this that will leave him remembered a a remarkable singer songwriter drake 's voice is deep and haunting his guitar is surprisingly rich a few of the song also have orchestral accompanyment way to blue fruit tree etc and they are equally gorgeous fruit tree i think is one of the most sad and beautiful song i 've ever heard it make my heart heavy every time i hear it and quot man in a shed quot is one of the most fantastically catchy tune i 've heard to date it 's enough to make me hit the repeat button on my player multiple time if you want to get some of drake 's music this is a good place to start and though i think most people will probably buy quot pink moon quot first because of the volkswagon commercial i think quot five leaf left quot ha the edge and fan of the two minute ditty quot pink moon quot certainly wo n't be disappointed to digest this album 

a very pleasant album immaculately produced perhaps a masterpiece of british folk the song are nice and pleasing very pleasant to listen to relaxing drake 's delicate acoustic guitar work is fine and suit the song perfectly augmented by fine string and wind arrangement though they can be slightly overbearing at time and bright splash of piano drake 's own lyric are beautiful example of understated emotional poetry his vocal are distinctive very english and a good medium for communicating this poetry especially with this musical backing it 's a nice package certainly a hallmark recording for anyone interested in british folk 

in a recent review i calledtape from californiaby phil ochs a classic for it inventive barouqe treatment of folk on the other side of the pond england around the same time nick drake created another classic five leaf left the similarity between ochs and drake are interesting both expaneded the guitar strumming scope of folk music with orcherstration both suffered from depression a much harder illness to treat in 1969 and both died young ochs from suicide and drake from an accidental drug overdoese but drake wa more musically subtle he wrote about deeply personal issue not the political and social idea ochs choose and while tape from california feature hapsichords and huge score drake used quiet and yes depressed string section listen to riverman to hear drake more pastoral approach the quiet muted sound is from a quiet muted man drake often sings his keatsian lyric in a low tone just above a whisper you get the shy sadness of a broken young man in both the resignation of music and word drake is not trying to overcome his sadness but rest in it sitting still to witness whatever beauty he may be able to see and feel his music indicates that wa a lot and there is a classical grace and vurnerability to all the song through these he is able make you experiance his own sadness and resignation and immediately you connect with five leaf left drake wa also an excellent guitar player and a lot of his song have the impulse of celtic jazz backed by memebers of pentangle and fairport convention two of the best jazz folk outfit in england then these song contain an expert ressonce that take them way beyond average folk 

i wa lucky enough to hear to original lp when i wa younger a my father wa a huge fan of the ever thoughtful and often melancholy genius of drake there 's nothing i can add that ha n't already been said with one exception the re master of this album is showing it color in that there is a noticeable gain hiss from the original session tape this may have been a problem to deal with in the late 90 's when this wa re mastered and re issued but with today de hiss technology it effectively eliminates this slight noise that blanket the entire album they really should reconsider re re mastering this album again from the original tape and not from this master to make this a completely perfect album in both execution and final cd or dvd audio pressed result 

it 's impossible to me an educated 29 year old south american man describe the fellings that been brought to me by five leaf left a all nick drake 's record we got here sadness shyness fragility and above it all beauty but it 's a new kind of beauty which come from soul and it 's not just coming from drake 's soul this music make our soul more beautifull than before and i ca n't explain it with simple word song like river man are modern opus of the century with the string floating over the ground made by drake 's voice and guitar leading u to a state of grace and compassion i know it seems corny but it 's true buy this cd now and be prepared to see the world by another perpective 

what a revelation this wa to discover such a talent many year after the artist 's death now a personal favorite artist of mine for a few year now today and not too long ago one can hear artist who were deeply inspired by nick drake who to me ha one of the most peaceful but tortured voice that i have ever encountered during the time that nick drake wa alive his music wa n't nearly a appreciated a it is today this album his debut is also his best bryter layter 's pace seems a bit more sped up and lack his better song 'pink moon' wa my first album by nick drake but personally i just do n't care for the more stripped down sound this one contains weeping string and soft vocal it 's surprising that song like river man or way to blue were n't hit song in their day those two are also two of nick drake 's finest achievement maybe with recent artist like the late elliott smith and iron and wine we can appreciate drake 's incredible talent that much more not only wa he an incredible singer but the string section by robert kirby on this release is just simply gorgeous the great robert thompson of fairport convention also lent his talent playing guitar i cannot think of any artist with a more piercing voice than drake 's one that can split a man 's heart you could n't say that about any hard core band or heavy metal group that ha more shock value than they have songwriting skill no and for me it is hard to think of any other folk artist with a more powerful delivery this man nick drake wa a genius who died way too young at age 26 at least people are still discovering his music whether these people are generally happy people or sad nick drake 's music always touch the heart a with most artist one only wonder what could have been if nick drake wa still living today he could have become one of the finest singer songwriter although to me with only 3 album he is just that 

yes i confess like a lot of people i came to nick drake 's music because of that car commercial and despite my aversion to greatest hit package the first disk i bought wa way to blue i do n't have any excuse for buying a best of aside from monetary restriction but i do n't feel bad for being sold an album because of a volkswagon ad carlos santana once said it doe n't matter how you get the music a long a you get it and he 's a guy who openly admits to first really hearing john coltrane 's music in a jeep commercial i eventually did get the music a i listened to way to blue though i discovered that the song i liked the most river man and cello song and way to blue all came from the same album five leaf left i finally went out and got it and i'm stunned at how much atmosphere how much tone how much sensation drake achieves with so little five leaf left is a flat out amazing record it sound like the nostalgized memory of a passionate romance after a bitter break up and i mean that in the best way river man is a song that never fails to beautifully cause my spirit to sag likewise saturday sun consistently brings them right back up again a sad and beautiful bunch of music 

i 've tried five leaf left several time at the office in the car on my home stereo and with headphone frankly i do n't understand what all the hubbub is about the album rate near the top on everyone 's top 100 list and i had hoped that i would be enthralled by the unnoticed master i have no argument with the fact that his work is melodic the thought of mary jane and lush way of blue day is done i'm simply not enthusiastic concerning his voice and subject matter drake reminds me of britain 's answer to bob dylan donovan his delivery is effeminate and breathy compared to the zombies' colin blunstone i believe drake 's voice fall short in energy range and beauty lyrically five leaf left is lonely disparate melancholy and generally depressing i keep my copy handy for rainy afternoon in small dos i find five leaf left beautifully disturbing perhaps a greater appreciation of drake will take more time 

every song on this album reek of sadness not the put on pale make up and put on a show sadness but a genuine rejection of the idea that life ha any capacity to be enjoyed time ha told me ha a wistfulnes that perhaps the woman he imago in the song will take him out of the doldrums but the hope end there river man is a poetic dirge that perhaps using poetic license that the riverman of the underworld mentioned in greek mythology will take him away from this life day is done imago perhaps a typical day where at the end nothing ha been accomplished and is now coming to an end fruit tree worry about impending fame even the very idea of being recognized by people brings on more sadness nick drake rarely performed live though his performance were legendary though unfortunately no known recording exist though his lyric are closer to romantic era english poetry and not the wild flight of the imagination of syd barrett this album and all other release by nick drake still hold up his music is reflective and poignant rather than pointlessly morbidly depressive the orchestral embellishment enhance the music five leaf left is my favorite nick drake album though i 'd reccomend them all 

five leaf left wa nick drake 's first record and wa released in 1969 he left cambridge to record it a year before he would finish his degree but music wa his love so he followed it to london and the rest is history the album wa titled after the saying on the inside of cigarette paper at that time when it said five leaf left it wa time to buy more where nick drake 's second album bryter layter is very jazzy and complex with multiple somewhat upbeat arrangement and pink moon nick 's third album is very stark and somewhat quiet with really only the man and his guitar this album his debut is somewhat somber melodic and classically influenced with a sort of baroque heavy feel most arrangement here were done by nick 's friend and collaborator robert kirby beginning with time ha told me a beautiful psuedo love song with an uncharacteristic country style twang actually richard thompson on electric guitar the fairport convention member being of the same band a the man who 'discovered' nick drake at a show ashley hutchings the album go on it lovely course with the second track river man a beautiful lulling song which ha a true feeling of motion some say the song might be about the river in cambridge that one must cross to get from one part of the city campus to another in any event a gorgeous inventive song the haunting and melodic three hour appears next a song written about a friend of nick 's and featuring some great guitar work then come way to blue a classical sweeping song of great beauty it enchants with it violin arrangement day is done which in the past couple of year ha been covered by the talented norah jones is a pretty song with wonderful guitar work the next track cello song is my favorite song here it is absolutely gorgeous from the first note to the last and with it intensive rootsy percussion and full arrangement really is a classic drake song up with pink moon fly and black eyed dog a one of his most recognizable trademark song the thought of mary jane is a whimsical song with light wind instrument a accompaniment an even more whimsical version appears on the 1986 cd and part of the fruit tree box set time of no reply drake had rejected that studio version in favor of the one that appears here man in a shed is a simple unrequited love song and fruit tree is a brooding almost prophetic in nick 's case song about post humous fame like van gogh drake wa destined to live his life in obscurity the intrinsic value and beauty and importance of his art unrecognized by the world until he wa gone it is such a sad story but the only consolation is that his music is being heard now by more and more people all the time and we can all hope that somewhere he can hear u saying thank you and it is so beautiful the closing song here saturday sun is a playful and pretty piano track which nicely round out the album all in all an interesting multi faceted album with depth and innovation beauty and soul there is something timeless here something elemental those who have heard drake 's music know there is something special about it a kind of quiet mystery which reach into your heart and intrigue it until you find yourself just wanting to listen in the morning at night on a rainy afternoon in autumn the mood the essence of drake 's work just seems to suit our day here on this earth so well he sings of season of time of love and love lost of hope and of friendship of hardship and trying to overcome it of loneliness and heartache the stuff of life the mystery the joy the pain the love all of it a we live our life a we do our work a we explore and wander and inquire a we love our love win sometimes and lose others have our ups and down we find that music is great company and drake 's music and company is some of the best anyone who considers buying any of drake 's album should really consider getting fruit tree which includes all four official drake release once you hear his music anything le might not be enough highly recommended 

nick drake debut album sound like the starting point for a lost cult legend even though it 's nick first album he sound a though he ha been recording his entire life it 's a very sad album although not a sad a pink moon mind you but includes many more instrument than later work there is n't a bad number on this entire album every song is a work of art nick lyric even though they 're much more like poetry sound a though they were written in the 17th century they really are work of genius and beauty and nick wa without a doubt one of the greatest poet of the 20th century 

considering that nick drake 's music is utterly breathtaking emotionally connecting life affirming a it is it seems truly remarkable that his music wa virtually ignored on it initial release a chronically shy person how expressed himself via his music his breathy vocal and gorgeous acoustic guitar arrangement were without me understating this exceptional yet his song of mortality introspection dark night of the soul and mysterious haunting melody did n't connect with the record buying public some 30 year ago and this album his debut only sold a minuscule 2000 copy on release nick would go on to record a further 2 album of melancholic beauty with still none of the sale to sustain his career what followed wa a man who plunged further and further into depression and would eventually overdose on anti depressant aged 26 and only over the last few year have the plaudit and celebrity musician expressed their admiration and love for nick 's work even so far a to having a documentary about his life persented by 'brad pitt' nick wa one of the few english musician at the time taking folk music and moving into the new wave of 'progressive folk' introspective intricate music that added new layer of musical and lyrical complexity from the first song time ha told me nick intones in a world weary vocal over a lovely understated acoustic section time ha told me you 're a rare rare find a troubled cure for a troubled mind beautifully capture nick 's gift for combining pastoral imagery with piercing self revelation a lush cacophony of string arrangement mark out river man with nick displaying a bittersweet level of melody unlike anyone else at the time of this album release and with nick musing going to see the river man going to tell him all i can about the ban on feeling free not even the beautiful string and gentle guitar can disguise the achingly sad tone of the song way to blue is arguably one of the best known track on this album and rightly so it a song that highlight many of nick drake attribute remarkable instrumentation anguished poignant vocal subtle emotion accessibility an unsettling level of intimaticy and lyricism far beyond his year have you seen the land living by the breeze can you understand a light among the tree tell me all that you may know show me what you have to show tell u all today if you know the way to blue it feel like such a deeply personal song that you almost feel like your intruding on someone personal memoir yet incapable of ignoring it 's captivation content this album ha a fuller arrangement than later album especially over the largely acoustic guitar driven pink moon this album wa to feature prominent name in the growing english folk scene with dave pegg bass dave mattacks drum both of fairport convention richard thompson ld gtr ex fairport john cale celeste piano and organ ex velvet underground ray warleigh alto sax chris mcgregor piano and pat arnold and doris troy backing vocal all contributing to the album with performance virtually equal to drake own insular beautiful performance but nothing detracts from the sheer beauty of this album for those that do n't have any nick drake album this truly is a absolute must buy i ca n't think on any reason that anyone that considers themselves to like folk progressive or otherwise or feel that they have a wide variety of music that they listen to should not own this album is this nick drake best album i find that question impossible to personally answer critic point this album a his best bryter layter wa his most popular album and pink moon is my personal favourite go figure the fact that this man only sold 2000 copy of this album when it wa released kill me everytime it hear it mentioned and the fact that even with the re evaluation of his career and a world wide new found love for his work this album ha still only sold 250 000 copy and highlight that even music a stunningly timeless a this doe n't always find an audience all three of his album deserve to be owned because no one album feel weaker than another and they complement each other beautifully put it this way every single friend that i 've convinced hassled to buy a nick drake album owns all three of them this is timeless music that might have been ignored first time around but now is truly worth of the renaissance and i impore you to not pas on this like the listener did some 30 year ago utterly breathtaking music 

not quite a minimalist a pink moon which is part of what make it debatably drake 's best record and certainly the first album to get incidentally it 's also his debut the album is about a folksy a folksy get some of it is filtered through country time ha told me other time through chamber music day is done cello song the string arrangement are often quite captivating they ruin way to blue at least for me but give a lot of flavor to day is done and especially cello song not to take credit away from nick himself his meditation on life love and loneliness are often fascinating three hour the thought of mary jane i 'll admit it 's a bit hard to understand drake 's quiet mumbling diction but even then sometimes it 's nice just to sit back and let his soft baritone take you away the hypnotic fruit tree bit of this ramble sure river man man in a shed but all thing considered this is a hell of an album oh and if you liked van morrison 's astral week you 'd be glad to know that saturday sun is comfortably close to that album 's best moment i do n't think bachman turner overdrive could put out something anywhere near this do you 

when my good friend phil recommended this cd to me he helpfully provided a product advisory i'm warning you phil emailed it 's really melancholy stuff so make sure you do n't have any sharp object lying around when you listen to it like any good irishman i love mournful music and i have a particular weakness for suicidal musician especially the one that died too early to suck so phil 's word of warning were like catnip to me move over joy division nirvana and elliott smith make room in the case logic for some nick drake i soon found that phil wa right and wrong on one hand five leaf left feel like the saddest cd ever recorded you ca n't fake these emotion every poignant lyric every aching guitar chord and every weeping cello proclaim that this is the voice of a troubled and self critical soul nick drake died of an overdose at the age of 26 oddly enough of his three album this first one sound most like a suicide note granted there 's some debate among his fan a to whether his death wa indeed a suicide whether the overdose wa accidental or deliberate on one hand he od 'd on antidepressant even though barbituates were available and he did n't leave a note on the other hand he 'd already written fruit tree ha any musician penned a more convincing suicide note i doubt it safe in your place deep in the earth that 's when they 'll know what you were truly worth i'm sorry ian curtis closer may come close but nothing 's more depressing than that and unlike say elliott smith whose pop sensibility often contrasted his morbid lyric every note of this song amplifies it mournfulness still this album is comforting in it melancholia it doe n't leave you feeling suicidal because you listen to it and know there 's someone out there who ha felt your feeling and given voice to your thought in fact it 's perfect music to listen to at sunset on a sunday night when the day and the weekend are over and you have n't accomplished anything and you 're facing another 40 hour week of work related drudgery if you 're thinking of picking up a guitar and hiring a string arranger and writing a song about those emotion do n't bother you wo n't do any better than day is done a 2 and a half minute gem that perfectly encapsulates those feeling so cheer up all you sad people there 's a man out there who understood you even though he never met you i wish he 'd found a way out of the depression found a way to stick around write new song and keep his old song from being used in volkswagon commercial they say dying young 's a great career move but you miss out on a lot and when you 're dead you ca n't stop people from doing silly thing with your back catalog also even though people romanticize depression and drug overdoses they really are n't all that fun especially for those left behind but nick left u with some great music and we can at least be thankful for that do n't you worry he sang to u and to himself they 'll stand and stare when you 're gone amen brother 

this is my favorite nick drake album even though all 4 the 3 he released in his life and time of no reply an album of outtake are perfect this album ha some of his most elegant song with my personal favorite time ha told me and river man one can look at drake in many way he made only 3 album in his lifetime they were hardly known during his life and he ended up overdosing and dying quietly yet today this man 's work is more alive than ever with people discovering his melancholy and brilliance many performer spend their whole life releasing album tv show film poetry book and never reach anyone other than on a superficial level at best nick put out 3 album and touched the soul of thousand perhaps ten of thousand and maybe someday million it 's something to think about for budding artist what do you want to be remembered for some silly catch phrase a star in a trashy sitcom or overblown tv drama being a coked out celebrity a musician who put out a few hit album then indulges in endless nostalghia tour a professional celebrity who like to appear on talk show to do countless interview and occasionally doe film tv role just to keep the bank account full or for a really truly artistic work that will reach people for generation the latter is n't an easy road but it 's the only true road that you can take if you want to create something significant 

if you ask most of the general public who nick drake is about 90 95 wo n't know who you are talking about that is because nick wa unknown during his lifetime and today he is still a relatively underground artist however all his studio album are regarded a classic and all three frequently pop up on list of great album this wa the album that started it all the fascination his debut album is generally regarded a being le depressing than it 's successor it contains a lot more orchestration and world music influence overall it is a lot more richer in a generical sense the album start off with time ha told me a great little tune which ha some amazing instrumentation and ha touch of country music inspiration the electric guitar part is truly irresistable while nick 's voice is strangely uplifting next is river man this song is in a rather unusual time signature of 5 4 this give the song and unorthodox structure the string section is breathtaking the next song three hour is the first of two song on the album to feature a slight world music touch courtesy of superb conga work by rocki dzidzornu following on from that is a song that is widely regarded a one of nick 's best and signature tune way to blue this song wa also the title of a compilation of nick 's work released posthumously in 1994 day is done continues the rather autumnal strangely mellow feel of this album this song along with most in nick 's career feature a string section arranged by his good friend robert kirby who ha gained fame for his work with nick 'cello song s probably most notable for being featured in the good girl a movie starring jennifer aniston and jake gyllenhaal it is used in the scene where jake 's character commits suicide the superb cello work which give the song it name is also very reminiscent of the cello part in pj harvey 's song plant and rag 7 track in the thought of mary jane may be viewed by many to be a reference to the infamous drug marijuana this may be true a nick wa known to be a recreational marijuana user man in a shed is a beautiful song whose lyric give a meaning of isolation and seclusion obviously autobiographical in nick 's case the final two song are really great it start off with fruit tree whose lyric offer a chilling insight into the mind of this tortured artist the lyric to this song have often been used a a template for nick 's life and sometimes to describe his mental state finally saturday sun lift the mood slightly up a bit this song feature nick on piano and offer a glimpse of what subsequent album could have been if he lived and experimented with his secondary instrument overall it is a beautiful track that ha some jazzy bit in conclusion this album is definitely not a depressing a pink moon or a varied a bryter layter but it is still a magestic effort nonetheless nick is one the few artist whose every song is flawless and even if he had lived longer subsequent album would have almost guaranteed to be perfect 

i have to give this album simply 5 star not that i love every track just a much but most song are so incredibly beautiful that it 's impossible not to give them so much credit i 've only been into nick drake for a few month after hearing about him and listening to his album i thought it wa just boring ol' folkmusic and left it for what it wa but for some reason i typed in his name in a mp3 search program and ended up with a cd r full of song a new world opened which sound exaggerated but is not i ca n't say what my favorite album is a every album ha it 's own charm but five leaf left is the best to start with a it wa his debut album there are song on it which touch me so deeply that there are time that i just ca n't listen to them them being 'day is done' and 'fruit tree' the album is filled with melancholy but these song breathe out a type of sadness i 've never heard in any other music 'river man' maybe his most famous song after 'pink moon' is arguably his greatest song ever the brooding string arrangement lift the song to great height it 's unbelievable the only song that are hard for me to hear are 'mary jane' and 'man in a shed' not because they 're not good but i got to know them in the acoustic version a on 'time of no reply' which i like much better than these version all dressed up with unnecessary arrangement if you have n't discovered nick drake now is the time to do so he ha enriched my life i'm addicted to his music 

this is hand down just a stirring and beautiful album distinctive guitar playing the saddest voice you 'll ever hear this side of the red house painter this is one of the most haunting and elonquent album you may ever hear 

five leaf left the title itself seems a puzzle and this sometimes sparse yet strangely compelling testament likewise contains other riddle and juxtaposition foremost is nick drake 's own character who though lost to u saw nuance and meaning in everyday life that most tend to gloss over and seemed to follow mus hidden to most whether conversing with time in the opening track time ha told me full of foreshadowing of mr drake 's inner turmoil suggesting that we look through time and find your rhyme in way to blue or acknowledging the cycle of life in day is done mr drake is transfixed by the ephemeral element of life the cycle of season and the need to self evaluate he writes lyric about the deeper meaning of thing and the inherent tension of trying to live life fully without becoming mired in melancholy like a water skimmer shooting across a slow moving creek certainly mr drake wa also a master of understatement though i think the string section may be a bit much in a couple of passage the interplay of mr drake 's voice i'm unsure what adjective to apply to his singing his acoustic guitar and the conga and bass imbue three hour and cello song with shimmering elegance the original production wa excellent and the remastering accentuates the tenor of the song five leaf left provides an appropriate soundtrack for the in between season of fall and spring and the transitional space one often carves out of morning and evening 

nearly unknown in his own day but revered by his contemporary nick drake ha had a bit of a renaissance in the wake of of all thing the use of one of his song in a volkswagon commercial pink moon from the album of the same name but this album wa his first and in many way his best drake 's legacy is sadly pretty small three album during his lifetime and two posthumous collection his music is melancholy in way no one else 's is understated often punctuated on this record and it followup bryter layter by a mournful arrangement lightly sung in drake 's smoky tenor the music is effecting i find to this day that when i play this one when i hear river man i have a habit of stopping whatever i'm doing drake 's voice just compels you to listen and he so directly express loneliness fear and sorrow through his music that listening to him can sometimes be difficult for me indeed i only rarely play his music but when i do i marvel at it but to this record five leaf left is probably my favorite of drake 's catalog the song are consistently inventive and surprising and with the exception of closer saturday sun which sound forced honest sincere and brilliant several of the song have that quality like river man way to blue can grab you the same way with it pained voice over string and the thought of mary jane is really beyond word a sort of melancholy love from afar stance drake almost sound content in this a though the alternative would be too much bottom line this is a masterpiece essential listening highly recommended 

five leaf left released in 1969 is the first of only three album nick drake managed to get released in his short lifetime several of the album 's lyric suggests a delicate and fragile mind which might ultimately have led to his untimely death in 1974 musically drake 's music may at time appear a little reminiscent of donovan 's from the later 1960s in drake 's case though there are strong inspiration from classical music which is hardly the case with donovan the album contains several of drake 's best and most beloved song among them cello song time ha told me way to blue and thought of mary jane the instrumentation is in most case sparse with drake 's beautiful acoustic guitar a the turning point on the opening track time ha told me one may recognize richard thompson 's characteristic electric guitar and the sound of this number is slightly reminiscent of early fairport convention otherwise it 's danny thompson pentangle who appears most frequently on the record also string arranger robert kirby ha put a strong stamp on several of the album 's key track way to blue day is done the thought of mary jane and fruit tree summed up this is very fine album that win for each new listen if you are not familiar with drake 's music in advance however i recommend that you start with the sequel bryter layter which is without being lightweight at all probably easier to fall for 

nick drake five leaf left of all three of nick drake 's album only one of those ever struck me a fantastic made me absolutely fall in love with it and only one of those three ever felt like it truly lived up to the hype that album is pink moon that damn thing haunt me and i think about it at random time and feel an urge to listen to it immediately a love supreme is the only other album that doe that to me five leaf left however would come next for me it doe n't live up to the hype and i do n't particularly love it there is n't a single bad or weak track here they are all great in fact drake lyric are easily the most personal and best written here a against the other two album his guitar playing is a virtuosic a always but something about this album just doe n't feel right maybe because pink moon wa my introduction into drake 's music it will always be the standard for me to which i compare the rest of his work it may sound quite jaded but it is n't anything i can help only three song on five leaf left really hit me a classic and a brilliant 'river man' being the first the somber tone in drake voice accompanied by the slightly out of place string arrangement is the sort of thing john lennon and paul mccartney tried to do with 'a day in the life' but did n't quite pull of the second being 'three hour ' this to me might be the greatest song drake ever wrote next to 'pink moon ' in at a staggering six minute in length which is like the equivalent of 'mountain jam' for the allman bros it is truly a mini epic lyrically it is unparalleled by anything else the mood is dark a usually but i ca n't help but feel hope in the song melody the chugging bass line accompanied by almost renaissance guitar give an uplifting feel the song is pure genius the third being the lyrical genius of 'fruit tree' in which on his debut album drake confesses that he know his music wo n't reach the acclaim and recognition it should until his life ha ended poetic bliss a for the rest of five leaf left nothing stand out nothing strike me a blaam though nothing else is bad it just simply play and play well for a debut album five leaf left is incredible but it still showed that drake had more ground left to cover 

my favourite track on this debut album are those with a fuller instrumentation i e time ha told me with it beautiful electric guitar piano and bass way to blue with it melancholy mood elegantly expressed in a complex melody and sensitive string arrangement and cello song a hypnotic love song with a magical interplay of cello bass and conga i also like the thought of mary jane and three hour a brooding little number a with all drake 's work the overall mood is one of sadness wrapped in dreamy melody where the poetic lyric take the listener to far away place 

nick drake 's debut album five leaf left is a hauntingly beautiful album mr drake 's folk music is backed by the baroque sound of chamber music this provides a lilting background to his deep introspective lyric mr drake had problem with depression and there is a sense of melancholy that permeates the album but not near the degree of his later album pink moon quot fruit tree quot quot day is done quot quot the thought of mary jane quot and quot way to blue quot stand out amongst an album 's worth of stellar music 

each album made by this cult hero from the 70 's british folk movement is quite impressive but nick drake 's 1969 debut five leaf left may be his best drake 's strongly plucked acoustic guitar find a warm home with the guesting chamber music instrument and together they create an almost flawless misty rainy atmosphere which permeates through all of nick 's top class song it is astonishing that a young man in his early twenty is so vastly adept to writing wise heartfelt song such a cello song and time will tell me or song a profound a three hour or fruit tree the last of which eerily forecast nick 's posthumous rise from overlooked singer songwriter to cult hero safe in your place deep in the earth that 's when they 'll know what you were really worth forgotten while you 're here remembered for a while a much updated ruin from a much outdated style although drake would sadly never live to see his work at all appreciated many more experienced and popular songwriter are trying desperately for the skillfully executed eeriness and unpretentious thoughtfulness mastered on five leaf left 

pink moon wa dark a they come but five leaf left despite others saying it is the most depressing of the three or some other stuff it 's like an autumn morning or a dark night on the river it 's also longer and feature more than just the guitar nothing is a naked a pink moon but five leaf left is beautiful and if you have the ear becomes apparent with the first seven second of the thought of mary jane though to me it seems about drug five leaf left take me on a journey to the river forest star filled sky and sunset sometimes with a girl on my side sometimes not drake 's lyric a always are filled with lyric of hope depression life sometime i really need to take a music based journey to the place that conjure in my mind really experience the music actually you all should now that 's a testament that how some music can really be more than just a mere listen i think i would stop right now because five leaf left ha been described just by that last paragraph man this review wa crappy while not a good a other album some album even if they are n't the greatest to exist just cannot be said with justice at least my attempt at it show when you try to review album you really just ca n't explain just listen 9 10 

nick drake and five leaf left a classic folk album that is no mean depressing a others have stated it 's a visonary album of beautiful strummed guitar with a voice of an angel over the top with simple lyric too not over stretch our tiny mindsa beauty of an album a great artist who died too young well i suppose these thing happen for a reason 

i know this guy is supposed to be some kind of saint but this cd left me cold if drake ca n't be bothered to show a little emotion on this he should n't have bothered to record it 

whether you know it or not you 've heard nick drake before maybe it 's from his other album maybe it 's from that vw commercial maybe it 's just the sound of that quiet bleakness we all feel when sadness come to the door and doe n't want to leave this music life with all of u it exists in quiet lonely night chilly autumn evening and the muted grey of the world when it 's been raining all day during his too short musical career nick used music to look at those little feeling we all have and give them an exquisitely beautiful voice ok fine i 'll start talking like a normal person now i realize those comment seem a little silly it 's easy enough to describe how this music sound but it 's not a easy to convey the emotional impact it might have everything about this 40 minute jewel is beautifully composed elegantly performed and topped off with nick 's simple understated lyric which read a well a poetry his voice and guitar pretty tricky guitar work too are backed up by changing accompaniment some electric guitar and bass at time some flute some quiet conga percussion at others and most often a smooth string section providing just the right bittersweet background it 's quiet folk melancholy with an addicting quality that ca n't really be explained not everything here is quite a sad a way to blue or the eerily prophetic fruit tree either saturday sun add some relatively upbeat jazzy piano although it remains low key to the end time ha told me is uplifting in it timeless simplicity man in a shed is a wistful boy girl tune but the theme is a un cliched and downright humble a i 've ever heard it five leaf left wa nick 's first album and overall the most realized he took over a year putting it together after all if you do n't like the sound of string and flute you 'll probably want to hear the later pink moon instead which is basically just nick and his guitar either way just make sure you check him out somehow any drake offering is a treasure not to be missed 

this is a truly incredible debut almost every track is exceptional cello song is really beautiful time ha told me is another classic featuring great steel guitar work from richard thompson way to blue ha some great orchestration that is not overdone three hour includes some intricate guitar fruit tree show the profound mystery beauty and tragedy of drake 's tune saturday sun is one of the greatest thing he ever did it seems to me that few people regard this jazzy piece a one of his all time best but it is the vibe piano drum and bass on that song are terrific not to mention drake 's excellent voice the man wa definitely one of the greatest of songwriter it is too bad this did n't sell well enough to bring him the acclaim he so richly deserved try bryter later and pink moon a well for there are lot of classic in drake 's short catalogue 

this guy got passed me back in the day even though i basically bought every album that came out back in the 60 and 70 i wa listening to sattelite radio and heard a cut from this one and i liked the moodish thing going on and the hint of drug influence in there somewhere so i checked out a few website on nick drake his tragic story kind of hooked me so i bought this cd quite frankly i find this to be interesting but not something i would recomend to everybody the mood of depression stay so heavy that every song sound the same and make me feel like i am watching one of those pulse readout in a hospital room and it is a flatliner i suppose that some people dig this mellowed out sort of i wanna leave this world stuff but i get enough of it quick drake 's guitar work wa a bit unique in it 's time but a many time a i try i just ca n't quite get with this program it is good to listen to and then take a nap 

i am a huge fan of nick drake but this is my least favorite of his album and i have rarely listened to it since getting it ten year ago in fact i'm glad this wa n't the first disc of his that i purchased or i probably would n't have bought any of his other album this album is way too overproduced the best example is at the chime of a city clock which start out strong but is overwhelmed by the riffing saxaphone after each line sung by nick drake from the second verse on the first time i heard hazey jane ii i could n't believe it wa nick drake it wa so downright cheesy and dated the instrumentals on this disc border on easy listening also which ai n't my style the only song worth hearing are northern sky one of the most beautiful song i 've ever heard and fly although i prefer the home version he recorded at tanworth in arden in 1969 to the studio version it 's interesting that john cale wa a guest on this album but the result overall were subpar compared to the rest of nick drake 's recorded work i do n't think it 's a coincidence that nick drake 's follow up to bryter layter wa the extremely sparse pink moon album i think it wa a direct reaction to the overproduction that weakened his song on bryter layter pink moon benefit from the setting of just nick drake and his guitar while the song here are marred and dated by the arrangement i do n't understand why anyone would rate this a nick drake 's best work while i would n't hesitate to recommend nick drake 's music to anyone i would n't recommend starting here try five leaf left or pink moon first 

the one thing i 've been admiring about nick drake the last five year i 've been listening to him is his ability to really connect on a personal level with listener i'm one of his fan no doubt about it maybe not the biggest fan in the world but a pretty big one nonetheless he writes lyric where they feel so simple and complicated at the same time but in a way you can really understand where he 's coming from and in a way where you connect with him immediately in some instance that connection escalates to a very very personal level so personal in fact i highly recommend never listening to one of his album if you 're feeling down then again listening to one of his three album on a day where you 're feeling good might have a reverse effect and make you feel depressed instead haha i guess the best time to put on a nick drake album is a day where you 're feeling somewhat in between when you 're in one of those mood where you feel like appreciating a lot of honest songwriting passion this would be the perfect day simply put nick drake writes highly effective folk rock what 's really strange and one thing i still have trouble believing is that nick drake wa n't considered immensely popular back in the early 70 's we 're talking about a musician who wa on the same level a someone like john lennon and cat stevens are far a writing meaningful lyric in a way where you can easily attach yourself to every word and vocal melody he wrote he wa original and talented enough where he should have found a huge fanbase 40 year ago a fanbase should n't have been on hold for several decade in addition to that it get even more bizarre even back in the early 70 's most people were able to recognize greatness when they first heard it such a with led zeppelin pink floyd neil young and several other groundbreaking artist and yet nick drake flew under the radar almost completely for the most part at least he did here in america my parent never heard of him for instance and they 've heard quite a number of rock band from the same time period nick drake wa releasing his album there 's one more thing about nick drake i find absolutely amazing even more amazing than his ability to connect with listener through his honest lyric and well crafted songwriting it 's the fact his songwriting skill just do n't sound dated at all the music of nick drake doe not sound like typical early 70 's rock music you see not only doe nick drake sound completely different from most folk rock artist such a bob dylan cat stevens gordon lightfoot and peter paul and mary his album honestly do n't sound dated in the least they sound like they could have been recorded using today equipment these album sound like they could have been made today how can this be how in the world did people not notice this distinctive style nick drake wa going for back when he wa new so you see if you add up all these thing extremely popular fanbase nowadays completely different from 40 year ago when most people never even heard of him recording equipment that definitely made his music stand the test of time the fact nick drake writes from such a personal point of view it 's hard to believe nick drake actually did exist 40 year ago what an artist honesty is the main word when it concern connecting with people emotion and that 's what make it so hard to believe people did n't pick up on these touching emotion back when nick drake wa releasing these album why did n't he catch on no reason not to become extremely popular and be in the same league a other folk rocker picking a favorite song off bryter layter is a very difficult task i guess the longer song are my favorite especially hazy jane i with lyric written in a way i can almost exactly relate to the brilliant saxophone jam in poor boy or the creepy piano playing in one of these thing first his vocal melody are just a good a on the previous and next final album i'm glad to see nick drake is getting the appreciation these day he rightfully deserves he deserved success back in the early 70 's but unfortunately fortune and fame did n't catch on for him in the state the way it should have for plenty of mysterious reason listed above but at least people are finally appreciating his meaningful music nowadays it may have taken a long time but it finally happened if i wa in heaven right now i 'd pat nick drake on the back and say well it finally happened but too bad it took several year which i imagine he 'd respond with a simple smile a we 'd part way that 's the way i always picture it at least heh 

bryter layter is nick drake working with expanded orchestration five leaf lefthas subtle string but here horn and even female singer are added this almost sound likeforever change except that love album ratiated authur lee a mastero calling the shot drake seems to be a lone guitar player surrounded by adoring musician on bryrer layer his singing is mournful and self effacing a ever which make the album so effective the musical buffer around drake subtle voice only highlight his poetic modesty a a singer the contrast of his insinuating singing and the big shell of the arrangement work wonder listen to one of these thing first or chime of the city clock poor boy is a bit much when the singer sing poor boy feel sorry for himself towards drake it underminds the depth of his sadness the whole piece is a little mellowdramatic and insulting to drake who wa struggling with a serious mental illness but even this song is a good spin and the album a a whole is top notch 

it 's a shame but i'm just listen to drake 's work by now at 29 here in brazil we do n't have these release and the imported one are the only solution for this quot bossa nova syndrome quot this album ha great and happy song yes happy song drake sound happy singing at the chime of city clock and others but the great charm here is the similarity with the most beautiful album ever made van morrison 's astral week horn flute acoustic instrument and an haunting voice under service of wonderful composition there 's no cut here and on the others nick 's album le than perfect seems nick had quot the formula for the perfect song that make soul more bryter quot since i 've heard pink moon five leaf left and bryter later life ha become a little more bryter than before thanks nick wherever you are now 

i wa around in england in the early 70 when nick drake wa overlooked i wa not aware of him back then and quite frankly i am not sure that i missed too much i bought a couple of his cd based on one track a heard on a compilation album northern light which i really liked needle to say it turned out to be the only track that i really like just not my taste 

to actually access the music of nick drake you have to get past a lot of baggage the biographical legend the twee aesthetic aptly signified by the blandly psychedelic cover fey title and spelling the voice an adolescent whisper falsetto type thing when it 's not trying to be bob dylan once you do get past all that the album is a vaguely pleasant if indistinguishable wash of folk pop with unexpected instrument cello piano harpsichord sax etc keeping thing interesting some of the song sound like an earnest divine comedy there is one stand out track however 'poor boy' part jobim samba part legrand french cafe pop part stone gospel it pop melancholy suggests where drake 's true talent lay 

this is a awesome cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best song on this cd aretracks2 hazey jane 24 one of these thing first5 hazey jane 16 bryter layterif you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do 

anything from nick drake is excellent i own pink moon 5 leaf left and bryter layter i would n't trade them for anything 

all of nick drake 's music is so fantastic so streaked with genius and beauty it is truly a difficult task to pick a favorite album but if i had to pick bryter layter would be it with the sparse and ethereal pink moon following closely this album is perfect magical full bodied and brilliant from it opening note to it last at the chime of a city clock fly hazey jane i one of these thing first northern sky these are nick 's masterpiece and they stand tall and proud against any music created anywhere ever the horn string piano and guitar here all come together to whip up a musical confection so sweet and so nourishing it 's hard to imagine i 'll find anything i will enjoy quite a much when coupled with knowledge of nick 's story his sad difficult time in london isolated in his flat and working so hard on this album the album just becomes his crowning achievement after this album nick wa still producing pink moon is truly a seminal unparalleled album in it own right and his last four song reflect much of the pain and confusion he wa experiencing but bryter layter reflects nick 's belief that he wa soon to be riding a star and it show it wa meant to carry him on to fame and it is only the sad nature of fate that it took 30 year for it to happen but it did happen and for this i am very grateful to say the least if he had n't gained such success now i never would have heard of him or the story of his life nick drake wa the ultimate artist and is a true inspiration to many the elaborate and classy arrangement provide an unparalleled showcase for nick drake 's lyric voice oh what a voice and fantastic guitar playing some say over produced i say sheer heaven the crackling and glowing magic of this album now thirty year old it wa released in 1970 the second of three album released in nick drake 's lifetime ha made it way into the limelight at long last with song from it showing up on movie soundtrack and the album itself on many a 100 best album of all time list alongside other drake work i might add at least in britain for nick if song were line in a conversation the situation would be fine he wa shy retiring incredibly self conscious and with this music what a conversation pop this album in your cd player lay back in your favorite chair and enjoy 

the soft fingerpicked guitar at the beginning of introduction just get you into this masterwork of an album nick draakes second album is considered to be his masterpiece and rightfully so it is definetly his most up beat album but thats to nick drake standard the album is full of beautiful poetry nick humble fingerpicked guitar playing lush instrumentation and even horn northern sky fly and hazey jane 1 are probably 3 of the greatest song ever written by anyone if you are new to nick this should be the second album you pick up after pink moon but all three of his album should be in everyones colection 

the closest thing to a mainstream album that nick ever recorded there 's even a near rocker hazy janey ii albeit one in nick 's usual somber style i actually do n't think this is nearly a good a the previous record or the next one a bunch of weak instrumentals title track sunday fly and poor boy is the closest to overproduced drake get regardless there are several fantastic song hazy janey ii and it psychedelic folk counterpart hazy janey i at the chime of a city clock which is some good jazzy stuff one of those thing first is charming but slightly rambling and northern sky is one of the most resonant piece in drake 's catalogue which is saying something so it 's slightly uneven but the best song make it very worthwhile 

first off let me praise the string arrangement by a fella named robert kirby that are amongst the most enjoyable i 've heard on any pop folk album this album is almost sunny compared to the beautiful melancholy that prevades nick drake 's other 2 masterpiece five leaf left and pink moon of course bryter layter the title track is an instrumental that could just about fit on an antonio carlos jobim recording buoyant spirited and fun alto sax viola harpsichord celeste piano flute and backing vocal all add to make this quite a different affair than the other drake recording l love all nick drake 's work and each of the 3 album that he made in his short lifetime are so spectacular it 's hard to say which is my favorite whatever one i'm listening to at the moment is almost always dearest to my heart if you have yet to experience this great artist 's music just dive into it on five leaf left bryter layter or pink moon you ca n't go wrong 

people love to talk about their proverbial perfect desert island album quality wise nick drake 's bryter later could easily be on my list but that description doe n't sound quite right i imagine desert island a being dry and bright and isolated place this album 's much more suitable for rainy afternoon holed up in the condo stay indoors beneath the floor talk with neighbor only the game you play make people say you 're either weird or lonely drake sings on at the chime of a city clock the music too amplifies the urban cabin fever vibe the arrangement are jazzy but melancholy with a wonderful blend of wise guitar and playful piano and sad string and resigned horn the horn are crucial they help make bryter later that rarest of thing an excellent album that doe n't quite sound like anything that came before drake 's voice soothing and hushed and cool complement the song perfectly but there are great instrumental piece too bisecting and bookending the album five leaf left wa my first and first favorite nick drake album but now i find myself listening to this one far more frequently there 's still plenty of melancholy here on hazey jane i for instance drake asks do you like what you 're doing would you do it some more only to stop once and wonder what you 're doing it for but all in all the relentless depression 's been tempered quite a bit that album 's vibe is i want to kill myself because life 's pointless and i wo n't be noticed otherwise this is more like i do n't quite feel like going to the grocery store today and that resignation 's leavened too with a cautious optimism today may be shot but tomorrow 's at least worth sticking around for please give me a second grace please give me a second face drake sings on fly and then on northern sky he asks would you love me for my money would you love me for my mind would you love me through the winter would you love me until i die if you would and you could then come blow your horn for me it 's a lovely song but the pronoun alone are significant on both this and five leaf left there are time when the you refers to drake himself and the song become mere mirror place for tortured artistic sensitivity and introspection but on this there are far more moment where the you is someone else so drake is at least spending le time gazing into mirror and more time looking out window looking out from the darkened apartment at the face in the city searching for a connection with someone who can end the isolation 

steeper breezier arrangement on bl compliment his other bare bone melancholia rarely smothering the elemental sadness and acoustic excellence prevalent in near everything drake composed 

this is just a cd you 've got to have once you 've gotten to know it you 'll start hearing drake 's influence in musician after musician who know what he she is doing beck robyn hitchcock jim white lucinda williams david byrne vic chesnutt that 's just for starter the list of people who cite nick drake a an influence go on and on once you get this cd you 'll want to dig into drake 's entire catalog which unfortunately is only 3 or 4 official album amazing musician who made an incredible splash in his short life and limited number of recording 

definitely nick drake 's most mainstream release in his all too brief discography bryter layter is filled with more somber guitar line nick 's expressive vocal and even drum flute other instrument wow those element are a turn off for those who like more of his raw and unpolished music but a lot of the song on this album are just a emotional a those on pink moon or 5 leaf left though some of the song can do without the overproduction still worthy of a listen and of a purchase 

there were a whole lot of demon wrapped up in the brilliant but tormented soul of nick drake who succumbed to depression and death before his full talent wa allowed to flourish nick drake only left behind three complete album bryter layter being the middle and most beautiful one the string arrangement are superb and with sympathetic backing from the like of dave pegg richard thompson dave mattock and john cale the song really grab your heart in a year when the singer songwriter ha comeback from the wilderness the re issue of drake 's bryter layter could not of been better timed or more welcome this is the best way into his oeuvre ornate drenched in melody emotion evocative of a long lost london and it small smoky nightclub all told the song run counter to his melancholic reputation a evidenced by the very breezy and up tempo opening track hazey jane ii however in case you start getting the idea that it would all be dog biscuit you are soon brought down by at the chime of a city clock which reminds you of who you are listening to you stay indoors beneath the floor and talk to neighbor only sigh drake pretty autobiographical then nick drake 's finger pickin' guitar rise above all the musical arrangement to leave you breathless at his dexterity although the re mastering of the song ha given them much more definition and depth my problem with this re issue is in it time forty minute of music is not a lot in these day of c d perhaps island record could have found a few more song from nick drake 's back catalogue to give the c d buying public a better deal if your not familiar with nick drake the excellent way to blue is a must buy this clock in at way over the hour and containing song from all three album pink moon bryter layter five leaf left and the posthumously released time of no reply it give a good overview of nick drake 's work plus a nice booklet with an introduction by `nick drake devotee' joe boyd some photo and complete lyric not music to listen to when your low rather relaxed and contemplative mott the dog 

it 's no pink moon but that hardly matter the important thing about bryter layter is that it 's a sweeping and memorable and melancholic and uncannily beautiful a any other nick drake album but that it 's also more lush and intricate than anything else he 's put out he 's backed by various fairport conventioneer a well john cale on this album and it show the song are like siren coo seeping from a pastoral swath of english countryside except that they 're not weird and inaccessible like those of say tim buckley in his starsailor period not that starsailor is n't a wonderful album of course it 's just that it 's a bit well weird and inaccessible drake 's voice which sound like what would happen if velvet could sigh is in fine form and his maze like guitar construction are on display in all their universe evoking glory and there are also flute and string and piano and none of it sound even remotely pretentious the intricacy of bryter layter explodes like a flashbulb on poor boy which is an oceanic gospel jazz odyssey with samba rhythm and ghostly backing vocal hazy jane i sound like being left by the love of your life on a gorgeous summer day and at the chime of a city clock is like winning her back in the dead of winter one of these thing first roils with quiet bitterness and hazy jane ii let a sprightly soul rhythm percolate under a lyric that 's rife with claustrophobic paranoia northern sky is almost unbelievably gorgeous and it contains every precious memory i have of my childhood a well a the intense sense of loss i feel when it occurs to me that i 've left those moment behind forever there are some pretty instrumentals too neat 

bryter layter superbly pull one along with a gentle tension the music is arranged in a largely upbeat manner yet nick drake often sings about detachment a though it offer stability it 's a though he is the catalyst melding jazzy riff and structure with his lyric that conjure up image of what wa what should have been what could have been even the instrumental track evoke a longing a need for completion a yin yang that doe not quite fit how anyone could quibble about the significance of this session escape me pairing nick drake with peer such a thompson dave pegg and dave mattacks from fairport convention john cale and chris mcgregor who contributes some excellent piano on poor boy is like a folk rock dream team mr drake 's delicate vocal and the deft arrangement are the gossamer that bind this session and bryter layter should ultimately be remembered for it myriad strength instead of a foil for the rest of mr drake 's work or a a prescient laden testimony to mr drake 's subsequent depression and death 

bryter layter by nick drake is from 1970 which is already more than 40 year ago a a folk pop record it is peerless a an encapsulation of the era it is second to none and a an alternative album it rank among some of the best work by rufus wainwright or even joanna newsom a with every record of such staggering worth it wa a colossal disaster upon first release eventually sending its' maker into a downward spiral from which he never fully recovered let me preface this review that if this album ha any one direct comparison it would be parallelogram by linda perhacs another obscure and forgotten gem of a record i would rank nick drake a the jeff buckley of his generation a it take the boy and a guitar idiom and transpose it decade before buckley drake is also rather comparable to tim buckley jeff 's father but while tim ha a more neo folk whimsical touch to his album drake is firmly planted in the acoustic folk jazz genre although some song here are so stripped down that you would be hard pressed to fit them into any genre other than `melancholy' what make this album special even within drake 's own small discography is that it wa recorded with some very alluring musician of the time fairport convention and john cale from the velvet underground a well a beach boy musician mike kowalski and ed carter all of them bring just the right amount of talent to the table and are more than willing to play second fiddle to the lead instrument here which would be nick drake 's voice it is n't a very strong voice and there is n't a single song of his on all his three album where he display any soaring note or stretch his vocal ability but he ha a warm cozy quality to his voice akin to curling up in a corner with a really good old book i suppose this is one reason drake appeal to such diverse yet niche audience this is very much a `home' record and is best experienced solitary it must be remembered that drake made this record with the intent that it would be a departure from his first album five leaf left which had flopped considerably the jazz element were brought in in a move to edge away from the more pastoral element of the first record this wa in 1970 and it wa also the infamous year in which drake attempted to play live concert all of which went badly a he did n't believe in communicating with his audience and spent inordinate time between song tuning his guitar however drake 's interest in this album wa primarily to make an impact on the marketplace something that had eluded him with his first released and even john cale who contributed backing vocal wa sure of the record success much to drake 's horror bryter later wa released with little promotion and went on to sell only slightly le than 2500 copy it would mark the beginning of drake 's descent into further depression one from which he never fully recovered forty something year later bryter later ha received much acclaim partly because of the renewed interest in drake in the `90s and `00s but also because somehow this album ha aged beautifully it certainly a record that get better with time and song from it that i first heard in the mid `90s sound almost radically different now and seem to burst with far more life than i had imagined i thought this to be an anomaly so i went back and listened to his debut record but it did n't sparkle with the it factor that this album doe what add to it appeal is that the production is impeccable and very considerate towards the underlying rule that drake 's voice is the true star of the album and never do the instrument overpower his voice on most track all we get is drake 's pristine vocal clean and clear in super clarity it almost disconcerting that something of such power could have gone overlooked at the time of its' release because even compared to the other `folk' record of 1970 it is markedly different in almost all aspect bryter layter open with introduction and close with sunday both instrumental piece that act a prologue and epilogue the first true track of the album is hazey jane ii followed by the splendid at the chime of a city clock where he can rightfully be compared to tim buckley note that if you are interested in a male voice with a lot of gusto or power to it this is not the place to be looking for it drake ha often come under criticism for being a weak vocalist who appeared to `talk' over his song this is in part true in truth his delivery is mixture of singing and talking and his intonation is n't exactly conducive to a real vocalist despite this there is a certain warmth and magic to his voice like an old friend that will keep you coming back to certain track to relive them repeatedly at the time however i suppose his vocal skill were n't considered praiseworthy considering he wa up against some big name back in the day drake released only three `proper' album during his lifetime and this is undoubtedly the best of them if one had to choose a `best' track it would be fly and poor boy where nick really go outside his comfort zone in many way plus also check out those stunning background vocalist and their harmonizing and the closer sunday a beguiling instrumental on his next album pink moon drake would strip down even further to just his voice and a guitar it wa recorded in just two day and it sort of show while all of drake 's work can be considered vital i would recommend bryter layter and his debut cd a the most immediate purchase if you like this you can then venture to some of his other work such a the later compilation family tree that feature song recorded even before his debut with vocal by him his sister and his mother though it is n't a consistently listenable a this record this record deserves a vital place in any serious music lovers' collection and especially for listener who rank vashti bunyan meg baird andrew bird tim buckley jeff buckley highly a a forgotten gem from the 1970s it should finally come to posse the recognition it so richly deserved upon first release five star 

i wish nick would have a longer career and a longer life bryter layter it`s indeed a fantastic album you don`t have to skip a single song each one is so emotionally charged and intense in comparison to pink moon and five leaf left this album feature a fantastic band following nick`s chord at it best it`s hard to tell which song is my favorite in this album cause i love them all i own nick complete discography but this album to me is something really special if i would have to recommend an entry to new fan this album will be it the beauty about nick music is that even while he wa clearly depressed all song leave to your own interpretation it`s like a living soundtrack on your own life you will find comfort on those velvet chord and acoustic strumming paterns while listening to his beautiful voice my recommendation really get them all bryter layterfive leaf leftpink moon this were the only three album released by nick five leaf left wa the first but he wa unnoticed at the timem gorgeous album he went somehow notticed and gaining a following cult with bryter layter and consumed his own with pink moon a 4th album appeared later with 4 track that were going to be part of his 4th studio album that never happened plus a few other take on tap this album is time of no reply worth it 

this is the key nick drake album to get with it excellent production value and fully realized arrangement he 's in great voice and each song get a sensitive treatment whether it sonorous string or a bopping horn section or a quiet bluesy piano the sax on at the chime of a city clock it is worth the price of admission sad he could n't hold it together enough to make more music sad he died so young but many in his era 's british folk scene suffered too this album is haunting and optimistic just listen to hazy jane ii a classic which creates a mood from the first to the last track 

the weakest of the three album released in his lifetime bryter layter suffers in comparison to what came before the brilliant five leaf yet and what came after the sparse pink moon comparison within the catalog of one 's own work is largely inevitable but here it can be fatal if you 're new to drake i 'd with no modesty recommend both my review of and the album five leaf left a a superb introduction largely eschewing the baroque folk of his last record drake seek a jazzier sound a more varied approach and some material thats upbeat the result are mixed song like the horn driven upbeat hazy jane ii suffer from almost kitchy arrangement and poor boy may be the only song on record by nick drake that i really quite dislike the style just doe n't seem to sit with his voice on the other hand in some way it the piece without any of his vocal that may excel the most the opener and closer introduction and sunday and the title track all combine a sort of baroque string sound with drake 's folky sensibility and what almost feel like a pet soundsish feel and certainly the darker but still jazz influenced setting of at the chime of the city clock check the string after the vocal too breathtaking hazey jane i the absolutel beautiful fly and the stunning northern sky the latter two featuring some mesmerizing playing from john cale in particular his delicate viola countering drake 's voice on fly succeed much better you know it a great album but in my mind it always doomed to be the worst of nick drake 's catalog which is to say it still amazing check the other two first then come back to listen to this one 

i have only recently become aware of nick drake 's music but now i know all his album pretty well they all provide very fine song and great music though some of the posthumously released album are somewhat uneven among his three original album i have come to the conclusion that his second bryter later is his most successful and in any case the album i would only recommend a friend it is his most produced album with musical assistance from the three member of fairport convention richard thompson dave pegg and dave mattacks furthermore contributing john cale on a few number several track have tasteful stringsarrangements written by nick 's good friend robert kirby all the song are good but you obviously get your favorite one of these thing first is a quiet and very beautiful song with nice accompaniment by paul harris ed carter and mike kowalski fly with nice contribution from john cale at the harpsichord and viola is number seems to be better every time you hear it perhaps most moving on the album if that title doe not go to the album 's second track with significant contribution from john cale northern sky this wa the song i fell for the first there 's something magnificent about this beautiful and airy number poor boy is almost a little jazzy with strong vocal backing from pp arnold and doris troy there 's something very liberating unpretentious over both lyric and music the same can be said about hazey jane ii which also ha fine lead guitar from richard thompson hazey jane i is a totally different song a i hear it they have only the title in common also a nice song with backing from mattacks and pegg there are three instrumental track are all fine and well distributed across the album a 1 6 and 10th trackson all track you have drake 's acoustic guitar which he mastered to almost perfection a strong album that deservedly ha become a classic albeit pretty long after it release in 1970 where it wa almost unnoticed 

nick drake bryter layter it go without saying that bryter layter is one of the most difficult album in my collection coming along in a time of music when damn near every album wa difficult this manages to be even more so adding to the fact is that no other album by drake is this busy but more so than that i do n't know if i actually like this record i have listened to it over and over again but i do n't think i even like it in the slightest bit much in the same way that i think sleep dirt by frank zappa is a fantastic record but cannot stand to listen to the damn thing bryter layter suffers equally i think this is a nice or at best decent record despite the fact that i often find it impossible to listen to it for me many of the song here are forgettable and stand out very little in my mind if at all 'hazy jane ii' stand out the most in my mind but mostly because i hate the song i truthfully find the whole whoa is me folky jazz number incredibly pretentious and trite though i can respect and fully understand why so many consider it a full blown classic and the star of bethlehem on this record 'introduction' stand out to me because it is the part of the album i love the most drake 's fantastic finger picking of acoustic guitar ha been one of the thing i love about him most his knowledge of alternate tuning and wide range and reach make for one underrated player 'at the chime of a city clock' is the only other standout for me the subtle drumming mixed with the bright string remind me of central park in the winter the song is beautiful a for the rest of the album i could n't even begin to describe another song with out hearing it because they all seem so blaa to me what doe n't help this album for me is that the fantastic guitar playing of thompson is really out of place on a drake record and drake 's own guitar playing is ofter lost in the production which also on this album is some of the worst i have ever heard but what really bother me about this record is that it is without a doubt drake 's most depressing album lyrically and musically it is a bright is a sunny may afternoon i always thought if i heard an album like this it would be genius much like lou reed 's berlin but i must say bryter layter totally put all this to rest it is just down right annoying and for those people out there who do n't listen to the lyric they know all the world but not what they mean which blow me away this would seem like a happy album which it totally is not so no i ca n't truly give this a better rating than a three because it simply is n't that good with all hype and tragedy aside drake wa a genius but genius doe n't always work out for the better a attested to here 

maybe i just want some of it too but one of the greatest glory is to know that you have encouraged someone else to enjoy something life enhancing that is the honour bestowed on one of my best friend who introduced me to nick drake by telling me to shut up stop criticising the cover and listen to the bloody music his word not mine five leaf left is a different more depressing more restrained kettle of fish from this and this well it is one of the greatest solo album made ever yes ever it is a subjective statement whereas i often try to wonder what others might think of an album i have no mean of conceiving a critical report of this one perhaps some of the music might not hit home with you perhaps drake 's voice will prove dull or frustratingly depressing i ca n't tell all i can say is this is truly beautiful song like hazy jane pick which ever one you want or one of these thing first or northern sky go beyond pop or folk or normal mortal range drake entered the legion of immortal musician among his fan not just because he died so young lennon 's death did not influence my preference for mccartney but because he reached so many and still doe his are not just word for youth either my father bought this on the basis of the introduction and love the rest too it 's awe inspiring acoustic guitar astoundingly mature use of string a beautiful annoying to use this word so much but there is no other to express the sentiment voice clever haunting moving lyric an album that work and now i understand the cover we cannot empathise with the genius who feel isolated from his own world but perhaps by seeing his humility hearing his message we can touch something of well that too is subjective and for you to work out alone 

nick drake 's quot bryter layter quot is an awesome cd my favorite song on this cd is quot fly quot i love this song it is soft simple light and exceptionally mellow it reminds me of water because it is cool and crisp of extreme necessity it drenches and wash the soul freeing and setting it free kind of like a fly i find this cd to be the best that i have ever heard i love group like bread ambrosia and fleetwood mac mr drake definitely had his on sound and nobody i do not think that anyone could ever produce such lovely music a he did i wish that he could have produced more either way what he left behind wa indeed a legacy i am truly blessed by listening to such music that inspires the sens and the heart mr drake 's music is truly touching and soothing to the soul 

aw no not another hippy not another counter culture lifestyle mullah ok it look that way but first let 's check nick drake 's hippie dom credential 1 centre parting check 2 floral shirt dungaree check 3 being on island record check 4 standing in the wood with an acoustic guitar looking meaningful check so he meet the criterion but doe he have a pleasing cynic bashing soulful music designed in a genuinely conspiratorial sense to make your wobbling correspondent eat his facetious word with side order of tofu and quorn of course he doe 'bryter layter' is yet another excellent surprise this one is screaming 'winner' before you even get to the music the sleeve reveals he ha john cale and richard thompson who is rapidly becoming one of my all time hero in tandem so you instinctively know he 's running from the winning block drake 's from the cat stevens school of smoothy folk pop but he 's far from drone and earnestness he 's got torrential string ringing guitar and more impressively good song in abundance a big music in a small sense but it compliment his sweet lyric and melody without swamping them thompson 's influence is immeasurable not just here but in music generally he 's enriched work from sandy denny to david thomas and his enigmatic ism are seized on by drake who us them a a platform for his own success a building block to his own particularly pleasing house of trick on top he 's got the best use of flute and string since tull 's sumptuous 'reasons for waiting' which a fair block of 'bl' is very like and a vital vibrant album result sure drake look all woodstock wet and wimpy but his voice ha a sandpaper smoothness and his song very definitely have depth insight and unity he tick the creative box much more than the deliciously sarcastic one above and therefore he emerges with kudos and no shortfall of credit he 's nowhere near the genius roy harper is see that thompson again but 'bl' is firmly on the right track and can fight it 's corner with vim and plenty of pride so pun well and truly on the back burner and is n't it cute the way that my review are circular one last condition doe nick drake have a deserved 5 star brilliant album check 

what can i say about nick drake that ha n't been said it wa very late one night i wa writing at my computer with the radio on suddenly there wa this beautiful song by a woman i wa instantly captured by it so i got the phrase gonna see the river man gonna tell him all i can i typed it into google and discovered the amazing nick drake the radio song wa a cover version funny it took second for me to become a fan and within minute i wa here at amazon uk ordering his album what a amazing song writer and singer then i discovered his recording were some 40 year old and it broke me to learn he died back in 1974 in a accidental suicide how can someone like nick die it doe not enter my mind that the man who wrote all those beautiful and unique song can simply die and that wa back in 1974 those song could have been written today they have n't aged a month i would say this one is my favorite album from a man who never wrote anything below brilliant one of these thing first and the sweet sunday are my favorite track i cannot grow tired of this on the other hand i'm very happy to know he is getting today the recognition he deserves the song are so sharp and intimate you can almost recreate the feeling if such a thing is possible the singing is so full of truth the arrangement are so tasteful nick drake is the rare kind of artist who really connects there 's no noise just the full experience god bless you nick you did it 

the cinematic instrumental introduction open this treasure trove of an album and is followed by hazey jane ii a lilting dreamy pop number at the chime of a city clock ha it jazzy moment with lovely sax while one of these thing first with it lively piano is the closest drake come to happiness the wistful and spacious hazey jane i is followed by the title track an elegant breezy instrumental and the sublime fly this version with it fuller instrumentation is my top favorite nick drake song displaying the man at his best in it exquisite spirituality poor boy is a jazzy r amp b song with soulful backing vocal while john cale 's celeste piano and organ contribution on northern sky make this track a classic like two of his collaborator richard thompson and cale nick had his own poetic voice from the beginning and his legacy is being rediscovered by a new generation of musician this album is the perfect entry point to investigate drake 's magic so many style but so coherent bryter layter 's variety sympathetic production and breathtakingly beautiful song make it my favorite by this gifted artist 

nick drake 's second album bryter layter is the quot lightest quot sounding of the three he released during his lifetime while not happy by any mean there is a breezy sound that flow throughout the album that add a lighter touch to such brooding track a quot fly quot quot poor boy quot and the two quot hazy jane quot song the standout track on the album is the incredible quot at the chime of a city clock quot which dig at the depth of the man and he confessionally lay his thought on the table another striking album from the troubled yet talented singer 

after the rainy mournfulness of his debut five leaf left nick drake 's second album 1970 's bryter layter present a warmer jazzier treatment of his sensitive song flute and saxophone replace the somber violin and cello and many track take a more uplifting feel moving drake 's sound closer to van morrison 's moondance than fairport convention 's liege and leif i never felt magic crazy a this i never saw moon knew the meaning of the sea i never held emotion in the palm of my hand or felt sweet breeze in the top of a tree but now you 're here brighten my northern sky he sings on northern sky and one can almost see a humble smile on the handsome schoolboy face of the shy singer songwriter in fact all song except the woeful hazey jane saga seem to be more contented than nick 's previous work he manages to be sweet buoyant and peaceful without sounding generic oversentimental or boring the only way in which bryter layter is a step down from five leaf left is it instrumental track drake 's ability to pierce emotion doe not transfer well into this format the title track and sunday dither into weightlessness besides that the more bryter layter is a golden a nick drake 's other work 

well you pretty much have no excuse for lending an ear to nick drake 's three album like many artist that manage to only release three album each of their record are so different and good that it 's quality over quanity while drake 's album do n't score a hat trick together all of them are worth listening to and all of them are quite stunning nick drake tried something new with bryter layter and it sound the best when the right mood hit just like nick drake 's other album actually bryter layter is lighter than the rest of the album and is brilliantly orchestrated drake still ha that beautiful guitar playing though i think his playing is le highlighted not quite a shimmering a five leaf left or pink moon but it doe n't need to me his voice is a usual stunning and evokes all kind of thing his lyric are a good a you 'd expect from him and the other instrument are brilliantly used a they are also a highlighted part of the record a mentioned before this is probably his most experimental of the three all kind of thing show up like flute string piano percussion horn saxophone bell john cale plodding drum other kind of guitar and bass it 's closer to chamber pop or at least that 's the best i can make a connection to than folk music at least in some of the song three instrumentals also make the cut for the song themselves they all have quite to offer the three instrumentals are all beautiful guitar piece with other instrumentation evoking mood like you would n't believe some of it is indeed quite jazzy like poor boy which sound actually like bossa nova at time northern sky twinkle beautifully a it 's one of the best track on this album and it 's a love song that doe n't resort to cliche the hazey jane song at the chime of a city clock no bad song really you get ten evoking piece that shimmer with beauty well your getting nick drake and that say it all this album doe n't feature his best guitar playing that belongs to pink moon but it perhaps show nick drake 's amazing way of beauty well it 's just a fantastic showcase for nick drake hate to sound like the amazon editor 's review but it is nick drake is the best folk artist in my opinion and it show in his three album get it now 9 10 

this is so totaly relaxing that it take actually a few listens to notice a few annoying thing nick can only sing in one voice nick can only write lyric that convey one kind of feeling nick can only play the guitar in one particular way and in one quite particular tuninghe ha basically one style i you like smooth romantic but somewhat sad music a i do once a year this is a rewarding listen 

this is nick drake 's most upbeat album which is n't saying much i realize he doe combine element of smooth jazz horn line and sax into his folk sentiment it work well together while i would n't call it a happy album it is nice smooth and mellow a always drake 's lyric are built upon a series of image mostly derived from nature personally i find them the strongest element of his composition but in this album the music is superb a well 

it took me a while to decide whether to tack on that fifth star or not it feel unfair to give any drake album a rating le than perfect but this is the only release where the production and arrangement did n't entirely mesh with nick 's vision he wa first amp foremost a brilliant songwriter if i may be forgiven for making such a simplistic understatement with a talent for beautiful folk melody and lyric that read like fine poetry he used odd guitar tuning and chord nobody else had even thought of yet made it all sound completely natural every time i bought a 'new' drake album i had n't heard i could n't get it out of my stereo for at least a week or two every person i 've played them for ha completely fallen in love with the music and gone out to buy copy of their own it never fails though nick lived a short life and left precious few recording behind they remain a universal and personal a anything i 've ever heard ultimately though i give just four star here bryter layter is overridden with even more trimming and embellishment than his 1969 debut on five leaf left the string and backing musician added nicely to nick 's gorgeous song without being overwhelming here they tend to drown out the beautiful simplicity of the song on offer and consequently make the whole thing seem somewhat dated it 's a touching and personal a anything nick ever did but this release ha always been the one i listen to the least this is all a matter of personal taste true but then so are all opinion on music to begin with robert kirby 's string arrangement are well done and sweetly soothing but adding them to the degree heard here is like drowning a canvas in layer on layer of paint when just one simple coat would be just right so what else is different this is the brightest and dare i say happiest of nick 's four release quot hazey jane ii quot ha the most pep and energy of all drake tune even going so far a to ride on a steady drum beat and include an upbeat sax solo three strong female voice give quot poor boy quot an extra backup before it fly away with the humbly hopeful quot northern sky quot quot one of these thing first quot glide over a sunny piano quot fly quot is a simply perfect songwriting gem that make you close your eye and dream of happy place far away a couple string drenched instrumentals round thing out before an ending that come all too soon a much a i love what 's on offer here i still prefer the simple power of nick 's velvety voice and unique guitar alone and i find myself listening to the bare bone pink moon more than all his other album combined if you 're merely curious go for that or five leaf left first there 's a compilation way to blue but once this music touch you you 'll only want them all anyway look up bryter layter later once you 're already hooked then join the rest of u in wishing there had been more 

i think this could be his best album i think the best track on the first album might be better than the best one here but overall bryter layter is probably the better of the two i defy anyone and i mean anyone in rock n' roll today to write something a perfect and a beautiful a say fly or at the chime of a city clock drake 's voice and guitar work a well a the beautiful orchestration of robert kirby and guest appearance by john cale and fairport convention member among others make this a lush and truly incredible album nearly every track is a classic this timeless album is like all of drake 's catalogue essential he just may be the best post dylan singer songwriter and certainly until recently an underrated and unsung figure 

nick drake wa one of those artist whom i 'd heard praised a thousand time in the past but by whom i had never heard even a single note so when i walked into border a couple month ago i had n't thought about him in month and had no intention of getting anything of his but when i saw his name out of the corner of my eye in the folk section something i ca n't say what impelled me to pick up a copy of bryter layter i had no idea what i 'd find inside and that made listening to this album for the first time all the more magical the categorization of music is a futile exercise at best but bryter layter is especially hard to pigeonhole into a single defined style the music contained herein is just a likely to recall or rather foreshadow the jazz pop of joni mitchell 's court spark poor boy a the british folk of the fairport convention one of these thing first dressed in nick drake 's exquisite guitar and string straight out of yesterday accessorized by delicate flute and harpsichord but then you have that alto sax appearing from nowhere in the baroque folk pop of at the chime of a city clock or the peal of distant tom tom thunder in hazey jane i and i swear the entire belle sebastian catalogue might well be modeled on hazey jane ii fly sound like some timeless nineteenth century art song it 's so lovely and yearning and northern sky i do n't know where this come from and i do n't especially care i just know it 's one of the most beautiful song i 've ever heard maybe the most accurate comparison i can make is to van morrison 's contemporaneous similarly impossible to classify masterwork astral week but that still that doe n't do mr drake and his record justice maybe bryter layter doe n't defy categorization so much a it simply ignores it it pastoral world cannot be limited by such tag a folk or rock or any other label you care to think of or invent i'm a musical adventurer i love to discover new artist and new album and new sound but the best music the stuff that really stick with you is familiar not samey or derivative but familiar comforting so when you listen to it even though you 've never heard it before you have heard it before if you know what i mean like meeting an old friend for the first time like bryter layter 

nick drake wa a selfless songwriter his own identidy on this planet meant le to him than his music did when his music failed to find an audience all that wa left wa the feeling of a remnant of something that 's passed it is hard for me to be judgemental on someone for his possible suicide when you listen to the man 's music and find that person put all of his very existence into his song not that it would have been the right thing to do but the amount of healing thru song this man left on all three of his album 's is a lifetime 's worth bryter layer is probably my favorite one a it still ha the feeling of someone who hope to reach people which is hard to find on his last album pink moon which is quite a personal album though still a masterpiece even the instrumental 's are stunningly good his piano playing is both tasteful and subtle at the same time which lead me to suspect he may have been just a gifted a pianist a he wa a guitarist but may have been disciplined enough of a songwriter not to overdo anything which is why all of his song 's sound so sculpted and finished he used his instumental gift to showcase his poetic whisper of a voice when i look back on his work 's the last thing that come to mind is wasted talent but on the contrary talent that wa recognized used with all humbleness and just never appreciated the beauty in it all is that we still have his album 's to find him immortalized nick drake is the sweet breeze felt in the top of a tree and the breeze hold 's enough beauty to brighten anyone 's northern sky what an artist 

hearing nick drake for the first time wa quite a revelation the guitar playing wa so intriguing and different and his voice really caught my attention this disc is awesome i would say a perfect a an acoustic folk album can be quot place to be quot and quot which will quot are especially powerful no frill on this disc just a man and a guitar there is an atmosphere of sadness that pervades this disc it 's great to put on when you have a lot on your mind it help me slow down essential 

simply put this is some of the most intimate and haunting music i 've ever heard in my life it is also one of my favorite album of all time i had read an article in 1990 which mentioned one of nick drake 's song and piqued my interest in his music for some reason his name stuck in my head for a few year even though i wa n't able to find any of his cd 's in store at the time i found pink moon in a store in 1995 and bought it immediately excited that i finally found something by nick drake this cd run about a half hour and the night that i bought it i literally listened to this album at least 6 or 7 time for what ended up being hour i just could n't get over it his voice so hushed yet so expressive the otherwordly tuning on his guitar the impressive and powerful finger picking style evident on each song it still amazes me today i really believed at the time and wa probably right that this wa one of the best kept secret in music and until the volkswagon commercial which featured the song pink moon it wa nick drake had struggled with mental illness and depression in the year preceding this release and the lyric desperate and depressing a they can be give an insight into his mind that apparently no one close to him wa able to achieve the surprise is that the end of the album feature the more optimistic from the morning which nick 's parent chose to quote on his gravestone pink moon an introspective all acoustic album with no instrumental backing aside from a brief piano solo in the title track did n't help drake 's already suffering record sale and his depression increased until his death from an overdose of anti depressant in 1974 his biography made me more aware of why this album did n't sell more copy until recently explaining that with band like roxy music dominating the airwave at the time pink moon wa not exactly going to take the world by storm and seemed decidedly uncommercial the fact that this wa nick drake 's final album out of only three he released is a sad fact but thank god this wa made my cd collection is nearing 2 000 and this album ha remained one of my top five favorite for the past ten year definitely a desert island disc 

the title track of this album which is evidently the reason a lot of people buy this one from seeing the vw commercial is merely the tip of the iceberg that commercial still amazes me it 's introduced so many people including me to something wonderful pink moon is 2 minute long but it is enough to hook right through you and pull you into nick drake 's beautiful albeit fragile and melancholy world quot which will quot also a deep quiet song is probably his second best known song for being covered by lucinda williams a few year back i 've yet to hear anybody blast nick drake for writing bad music so that 's good news for new fan although i like quot five leaf left quot a bit better this album is also essential to any music lover quot thing behind the sun quot for example is equally brilliant a is quot place to be quot quot parasite quot ah hell they 're all great the real challenge would be to decide on which nick drake album is the best not whether or not you should buy it 

there are three eseential nick drake album five leaf leftwith it chamber folk bryter layterwith it huge arrangement and pink moon pink moon is bassically drake on solo accustic guitar but drake wa no strummer his complex composing and full guitar playing he could strum pick and almost orchestrate with a simple accustic make these full song rich in sound like jazz classical minitures the sad drake alone is a whisful poiniant experiance and listening to the beatiful music on pink moon is a trip like few others queiting and disquieting sad and comforting essential 

pink moon is the one of the most revealing folk singer songwriter record out there which is odd because the lyric are impenetrably nonsensical i think the reason pink moon is such an emotionally stirring record are drake 's melody and the intimate recording style a well the strange guitar tuning provide the mystique necessary to buffer the lyrics' surrealist imagery the magic of this album is in it 's le is more approach that conveys drake 's mental state at the time a fitting elegy for one of folk rock 's most talented and troubled songwriter 

recently it ha become fashionable for artist particularly in the alt country movement to record spare stripped down album featuring mostly just their own voice and and accoustic guitar richard buckner 's devotion doubt and patty griffin 's 1000 kiss are two excellent recent example of the style but nick drake 's pink moon wa the grandaddy of the all given the sheer talent that burn on this record it make his subsequent overdose and death all the more unfortunate a for the song the title track is the signature song and thanks to volkswagon is now drake 's most well known song almost a good is the second song place to be also outstanding are which will later covered by lucinda williams and the instrumental horn after that the going get a little rougher thing behind the sun for example is a bit too rambling and at a mere half hour the album feel a tad slight nevertheless it is still a substantial and chilling work from an influential and tragic musical pioneer 

have you seen that volkswagon commercial where those college looking co ed look like their going on a road trip at night and then lay on the roof of their car and look up at the star well if you have you probably did or did n't now that nick drake 's 'pink moon' wa playing in the background 'pink moon' wa drake 's last album originally forgotten by mainstream music fan is now a testament to what a true artist is you could listen to this recording 1000 time in a row and not get tired of it and probably hear something different everytime the album itself is a melancholy moody sort of naive triumph although drake 's premature death of an overdose of antidepressant took down a genius in his prime we still have his great recording such a 'pink moon' and just wonder what if 

it 's impossible listen to pink moon without tear in the eye drake 's would be dead month later and music would be in the listener mind forever but the sound made by that 25 year old englishman with his word and single guitar remains stronger than poetry than vw commercial that i did n't and i wo n't see here in brazil than all the simple thing this disc is a statement of life and how big it can be drake is saying death is possible and only someone who knew the life can say it 

i thought with all the new found attention the song is getting due to the very nice vw commercial i 'd add this to my review this is a classic collection of short soft folk driven music with amazing guitar and lyric to die for it 's certainly is nice to see everyone finding out about his music finally artist like belle and sebastian certainly have nick to thank for their own style here in the new century like ian curtis after him nick wa a genius for the age he wa a more dark artistic type a songwriter one who wa simply a special unique voice way before his time or ours please feel free to check out my other review 

one of the greatest folk record out there not much else need to be said we lost a genius to an overdose not really appreciated in his time but this record will stand forever a long a it is available to listen to the stark and fluid guitar work is contrasted with a voice so soothing so troubled and so damning of the culture around it i ca n't really say much more this record is an outstanding piece from one of our greatest musician the remastered track sound every bit a good a they should perfection 

i remmber the day clearly when i first heard this record i wa in a record store live music in berkely and they had a listening section the cover really fancied me and i decided to give it a listen i fell in love with it from the first string i listened to the whole album and that day quot pink moon quot wa in my head everywhere i went i finally bought it and i still feel the same about this record it ha the imagaination of a lewis carrol work mixed with a haunting depression that dylan could only reach a few time in my life i have only met le than a handful of nick drake fan and one day i wa cleaning my room and from the t v in the other room i heard quot pink moon quot and saw it on a car commerical atleast that give me a feeling some people know nick drake this album just doe something to you inside you 'll just have to buy it and see 

never ha music this beautiful been made this is a precise peice of art and you only wish he had made 20 or so album it is very bare and to the point but it is also inspiring on a warm fall day or a cool night put this on and sit back and relax and let the music flow over you it 's pretty amazing and i do n't know why anyone would deny that hope no one doe beck 's sea change and the sunday must have been made with this album in mind so if you like them you 'll love this or vice versa besides the first song it is just nick drake and his guitar in a very stripped down personal setting that sound so fresh it feel like he 's in the room if it is possible to cry over an album of music then this is the one you 'll be cry over it is that beautiful 

being a big fan of iron wine sufjan joshua radin elliott smith and damien rice i thought i would try out this cd also bought five leaf left a he seems to be an original and i wa impressed nick 's guitar work is very solid his lyric poignant his voice mellow and his song strong the cd whip through quickly with it short song too short and i could definitely hear his influence in the modern day singer i mentioned above although i prefer the modern singer this cd definitely will work it way into my rotation i definitely recommend this album for those that enjoy this type of music if you prefer iron wine over blackeyed pea or sufjan over timberlake or radin elliott and rice over maroon 5 then you must buy this cd but do like i did wait until amazon put it for sale under 10 00 

of all the place to discover nick drake i had to discover him in yes the volkswagen commercial despite this method of discovery i am thrilled to have been able to discover drake his music can be dark and moody but it is always beautiful and always original his lyric though sometimes non sensical fit the music well they are mysterious and cryptic the song on quot pink moon quot are unforgettable there is the bluesy quot know quot the elegant quot from the morning quot and my favorite quot horn quot horn is a sparce instrumental track drake creates an atmosphere with this song that i have yet to see paralleled my only quam with this album is that it is over far too quickly with each listen i am left wanting another half hour of music despite this shortcoming i would classify this album a a true quot classic quot and would recommend it to music fan everywhere 

pink moon wa the first nick drake cd i purchased after reading a ridiculous magazine article a few year ago that compared him to cat stevens i may have set the bar a bit high for myself drake 's last album is probably also his least accessible and the first few listens can be something of a shock to fan of a style and era in which songwriter usually wore their heart on their sleeve there 's a much raw emotion here a on any singer songwriter album but you have to go looking for it nothing about this album is easy or straightforward and it 's easy to see why drake 's music wa rarely heard on the radio then or now but that 's why it 's worth listening to again and again until it all click although the album wa recorded in just two day it feature a polished and rehearsed sound a if drake had been working on these selection for year to settle on just the right vocal and instrumental combination most of the song feature only his guitar for accompaniment but thanks to his intricate fingerpicking the sound is oddly spare and full at once reading the lyric on the page is a bit like reading impressionist poetry and listening to them in drake 's edge of death whisper hardly clarifies the picture much a few of the song still have me wondering if there 's any meaning to them but they 're nothing if not thought provoking and over three decade after their release they have n't aged a day this is definitely one of those album that require repeated listening but like most such album it 's a nice antidote to most of what 's popular at any given moment 

pink moon 1972 is the 3rd and final recording we were blessed with by nick drake this album consists of nick alone vocal acoustic guitar and piano where on his previous release five leaf left 1969 and bryter layter 1970 he wa accompanied by studio musician also featuring john cale and with bass and string arrangement provided by the excellent robert kirby pink moon is an essential piece of music history and will be forever recognized a some of nick 's finest work although any of the 3 album are sure to please i own all 3 and would be lost without them how strange that nick died in 1974 5 year leaf after the album five leaf left wa released he is sadly missed a poet a wisened old soul who died at an all too early age yet the perfect age to preserve who and what he wa 

this is one of those thing you catch wind about and pick up at the store out of curiosity wondering what it 's going to contain you 're almost sure to find something special about this one though the first time i listened wa probably a rainy day and it 's peaceful quiet is soothing yet when looking at the lyric we see that nick drake wa anything but peaceful and happy still he somehow managed to take all of his inner turmoil and create something absolutely magnificent and unique which is one of the crazy thing about genius the guitar playing is reminiscent of classical run like a folk mozart combination drake 's voice is light and unpretentious quiet and naked the album 's stripped down recording only add to it 's ambience because you get to see the song a they really are a theory i dearly wish other artist would try there 's nothing about this album that lie it is only a man and his song and it can only be that do n't worry about classification or about what music you already like because this album will strike you the first time you hear it it 's music that ha no limit 

just to be different i'm not gonna spend this review rambling on endlessly about whom nick drake sound like or whom he 's influenced instead i'm gonna talk about his music specifically in this case the album quot pink moon quot ready let 's begin all of drake 's album are pretty terrific quot five leaf left quot is wispy and fragile sounding in a typical late sixty folksy kind of way the only thing that make it rise above the sandal wearing fray is the strength of the song themselves which when you think about it is a pretty good way to rise above the fray if one feel compelled to do such a thing drake 's second release quot bryter layter quot is something quite different this time the song while still genetically at least wispy and fragile are beefed up through a more ambitious did someone say intrusive production technique the end result is intriguing quot hazy jane i amp ii quot and burdensome quot poor boy quot in equal measure call it a draw which brings u to quot pink moon quot apparently drake wa uncomfortable surprise surprise with the pop star treatment of the quot bryter layter quot material because quot pink moon quot 's stark acoustic offering are obviously a bold reaction to it these song are so quiet and introspective that they make quot five leaf left quot sound like deep purple 's quot machine head quot but that is exactly why quot pink moon quot is nick drake 's crowning achievement if anyone 's song were meant to be recorded in a bedroom with nothing but a few wooded instrument and whispered vocal for accompaniment it 's drake 's just listen to quot road quot quot from the morning quot or the astounding otherworldly title track and tell me that i'm wrong 

if bryter layter nick drake 's second studio album from 1970 wa nick drake 's public masterpiece complete with a myriad of fantastic guest musician pink moon his stark and lonely and incredibly beautiful and let 's face it 'solo effort ' is his private one the song here are an ode to the night an ode to solitude to thought to dream to finding a place in the world that is uniquely yours despite the difficulty inherent in doing so pink moon is an ode to the mystery of life and a in the volkswagen commercial seems to carry within it this strange feeling of motion it feel a if it is moving past you a if drake is somehow fading all the while that he is singing it is ethereal and beautiful beyond word the second song place to be is truly a gorgeous lullaby and lead well into the rest of the album other standout track include parasite with drake 's languid barely awake voice crooning along to his brilliant guitar the beautiful and haunting horn which summons up huge depth of emotion with just a simple guitar melody short but brilliant this song lead perfectly into the mesmerising guitar driven thing behind the sun the ultimate song for artist do n't be shy you learn to fly and see the sun when day is done if only you see just what you are beneath a star that came to stay one rainy day in autumn for free other standouts are the track which will a sweet beautiful song which ha been covered by the like of lucinda williams and finally the gorgeous from the morning an ode to the beauty of the spirit throughout the darkness here there is light sounding patient measured calm drake guide u through his day with a reassuring hand he is here for a little of the journey but at some point he leaf u and we are on our own with only the music to guide u from that point on and what beautiful music it is 

the music of nick drake is like a dark look inside someone soul and this album is the darkest part of it after making 2 brilliant album that got little or no commercial acclaim nick drake became very depressed and made this in 2 night at his home brought the tape to the record company unnanounced then checked himself into a psychiatric ward this is the music of someone about to lose their life the title track wa used in a volkswagen commercial a few year ago but it is a classic song and is great the song on this album ca n't exactly be explained track by track but the standouts are pink moon place to be which will which i think might be the best song nick ever penned thing behind the sun free ride and from the morning if you are interested in getting into the music of nick drake i feel that this is the best place to start with believe me you will go out and buy five leaf left and bryter layter the same day like i did nick wa a tortured soul who wa taken way too soon 

pink moon will always hold a special place in my heart not only wa this my first introduction to the artist but wa also my first cd exchange with a dear friend the ramification of emotion and memory this album brings are at time overwhelming this album embodies all i ever wanted to achieve and all that i have in the most simple definition pink moon represents the true shape of music music in it purest form and most beautiful shade recorded over two night in october 1971 nobody knew he wa making an album he turned in the master tape and proclaimed i have no more song left to sing this is just a man and his guitar no more no le this is not about making a statement creating greatness or re designing the law of music but merely an expression and that is what music should be is so easy to indulge ourselves with production detail and ideal that we forget what true music should be 

although someone with a admittedly large cultist appeal nick drake 's music ha never failed to enthral or inspire those that are willing to embrace his work after suffering from two breathtaking beautiful but commercially underperforming album five leaf left bryter layter nick retreated into himself and produced his darkest album yet alone with nothing except an acoustic guitar and a piano accompaniment on several track nick sings his way through some of the most reflective poignant introspective work of his short career and the brevity of each of the song most clocking in under 3 minute only exemplifies it 's anguish disenchantment with nick quietly strumming his guitar and leaving his plaintive voice to exude emotion for me this stark world that nick inhabits is for me best exemplified by what i consider a song of anguish yet remains a truly truly beautiful song parasite encompasses everything that wa significant about nick drake and proved to be what wa to be his fitting swan song the retail poor performance of his previous album caused nick to fall into a psychically crippling bout of depression and thus `pink moon' wa the final album release that nick completed before his death and remains one of the most emotionally stark album ever created 

so stark minimalist and underproduced it make plastic ono band look like 1984 this is what make nick drake one of those artist everyone 's heard of but few have actually heard unless you can imagine any of this getting radio play that is only one song the album 's title track feature an instrument other than his acoustic guitar a piano the whole here is much more than the sum of it part i suppose that wa the idea here since only two song run seriously over three minute thing behind the sun parasite those two are two of my favorite song on this album coincidentally though that 's just because nick is such a good lyricist using metaphor and cooking up a stew of complex emotion title track which will harvest breed his baritone is warm inviting and sound very good this is a very good record though it 's so minimal it can wear just the slightest bit thin at time hence i 've rated it a full star below my favorite nick drake album five leaf left all three of his album are excellent anyway 

i 've heard well over 7 000 album in my day here on earth and this is a member of my favorite dozen i have a whole arsenal of adjective polished ready to go here but word really cannot capture what make this album so special the sound of it all is just shot through with magic sculpted in a musical language that escape the written word these are about the greatest folk melody ever a gift to the world from a troubled young man touched by a singular muse the whole album play out in under 30 minute stark and spare gorgeous a it get mr drake 's unique guitar style is captured in astonishing vividness on this bare bone production the piece titled horn which is only one minute and nineteen second long is a haunting a musical composition a i have ever experienced a minimalist gathering of single note that have a soul wrenching impact really ca n't be described just pure feeling unique and perfect pink moon which will from the morning songcraft at it finest radio ha guitar work that is astonishing i could go on and on about this thing few piece of art have ever had such impact on my soul do n't miss this tremendous outpouring of creative genius 

clocking in at under 29 minute and just the sound of nick drake 's voice and guitar with a touch of piano on the title track pink moon is an undeniable masterwork by a pure deeply troubled genius it would be the last record of drake 's short life a the story go pink moon wa made with just recording engineer john wood in the studio and it wa realized in only two late night session apparently when the session wa finished he dropped the tape off at the front desk of his record label without a word from start to finish pink moon is miraculous raw confessional and stark the bleakness of the proceeding is leavened by nick drake 's wonderful intricate fingerstyle guitar work and his gorgeous rich other worldly voice from the morning end the album on an optimistic note but it belies all the song that preceed it every track on pink moon is essential to the whole what is most astounding about pink moon is that it is utterly timeless almost any other recording of the period whether it wa british or american would be heard today a a product of the early 1970s not nick drake 's work and his guitar playing with tricky open tuning wa so technically outstanding while volkswagen ha been alternately praised and lambasted for using the song pink moon to sell car the auto maker did a great service by making this beautiful album known to a wider audience no music collection is complete without pink moon bryter layter and five leaf left essential 

many call this album stark depressing and disturbed yes there are element that are deeply sad stark and depressed but i find most of the music beautiful haunted and beguiling the title track is justifiably a drake classic and despite being used in a car commerical i still love the song the commercialisation of the song did n't hurt the integrity of it drake 's music is like that it 's completely in it own universe than nothing can ever damage it it 's so pure and so unique nothing can poison it in the eye of those who love this man 's work this is the most stripped down album drake ever did it 's just his voice his guitar his songwriting and a touch of piano in the title track that 's all that 's really needed despite the fact that his other album have beautiful instrumentation including appearance by richard thompson and john cale the stripped down quality of this recording really enhances it i'm not going to say if this is my favorite nick drake album but ultimately it doe n't matter with him all 3 of his album are so unique and special there 's no need to divide them up they are like chapter in a book all contributing to the greatness of the man himself i miss nick drake quite a bit but the album will remain 

somehow i 've come across nick 's music it 's an exquisite blend of folk and soft jazz the story behind nick 's music and his life is tragic yet what he left behind is amazing three studio album and about four song to start off a new album to be started before he died of a drug overdose this album is by far his most melancholic the most sparse record i have ever listened to just nick 's vocal and acoustic guitar plus a minimal piano overdub on the title track the sparseness may be attributed to some people a making this album le accessible than his sophomore effort but in my opinion it show perfectly nick 's state of mind in his last year depressed and distant the title track start the album off it ha the most instrumentation and sound the most mainstream on such an underground album this song is a quaint song that explores the deep register of his voice this song is commonly known because it wa used in a volkswagen commercial in 2000 place to be continues in the same vein a the previous song the lyric illustrate longing and regret very confessional keeping in style with the album on the whole road make use of nick 's superb mastery of the finger picking technique on the guitar it sound very intricate and masterful which will is again great but it ha something extra nick 's voice seem to have a lot of hope in them and are n't full of regret and darkness it 's a beautiful song horn is a great instrumental that show off the musicianship of nick it lead well into the next track thing behind the sun which is strummed in a great minor key and ha an awful lot of melancholy shrouding it know is the most simple track on the album built around a four note guitar ostinato it prof that you do n't need a phil spector treatment to stisfy your target listener parasite is written undoubtedly from how nick saw himself a worthless and a burden it 's a chillingly realistic track that unnerved me deeply free ride ha some nice harmonic and use of key the song is quite unpredictable but nick keep the song flowing well harvest breed sound like it 's in a slightly lower key than free ride it may be short but then so is the album at only slightly over 28 minute from the morning is a beautiful way to end the album and is considered to be one of his best song one of the lyric adorns the back of his headstone at his resting place in his hometown 's cemetery overall pink moon may be short but it still is a lovely album many people consider it too depressing to listen to because they think it emphasis too much on melancholy well what kind of album do you expect a clinically depressed musician to make however i believe there is hope in a lot of the song showing glimpse of nick fighting the horrible depression that plagued him until his death simply an exquisite album 

brief sparse warm yet haunting drake 's folk classic ha stood the test of time his playing is masterful concentrating on relatively simple melody but putting amazing unpretentious riff in between and that voice ha love and fear ever been articulated vocally like that 

although the newly discovered attention to this song seems to be by way of a television commercial i must say that the folk at vw knew this album and the feeling it encompasses that much is crystal clear a one watch the individual surrounded by the clear night sky who then decide to leave a loud obnoxious party and never say a word right on the mark vw kudos this album is incredible nick drake 's material in general is incredible but there 's something about this album that move beyond all the others it 's something you ca n't quite place your finger on but you will understand for some yet equally indescribeable reason this album in particular brings to mind joy division if you care to follow this album with quot atmosphere quot by joy division or the quot closer quot album in it entirety you will not be diappointed with this one get a copy drive to the most poignant place you have or know of and lay back and take in the beauty that surround you and the beauty this cd add to it something else to keep an quot eye quot out for brendan perry 's latest release and peter ulrich 's solo effort very very beautiful 

released in 1972 this wonderful yet short 28'29 album of acoustic music by english singer songwriter nick drake is haunting and sad yet is also quite hopeful based on what i have read the album wa recorded in a mere 4 hour which wa spread across two session that each started at midnight and lasted until 2 am instrumentation on the album is sparse and apart from nick 's husky and warm voice the only instrument used include acoustic guitar very unusual tuning are used with rare sprinkle of acoustic piano here and there nick 's acoustic guitar playing is quite good and alternate folk like strumming with some virtuosic right hand finger picking some of michael hedge quieter delicate and le busy piece come to mind the piece know is fairly interesting because it feature a repeated four note pattern on the acoustic guitar over which nick sings this minimalist approach stand in stark contrast to the comparatively more involved playing on the other piece a quick glance through the lyric suggests a lingering sadness and hint of self doubt although the music itself and the attention that went into crafting each piece suggest that nick loved his music very much this remastered cd feature picture of nick along with the lyric and photo of his original note made during the writing process sadly this wa to be his last album before his untimely death in 1974 of an overdose of antidepressant other studio album by nick drake include five leaf left 1969 and bryer later 1970 which feature a wider variety of instrument and are not a stripped down a pink moon very highly recommended 

like and not like robert johnson 's blue pink moon is nick drake 's masterpiece for the fan of folk rock but this record rock not yet is quite bluesy the unusual and spare guitar with nick drake 's unique tuning is reminiscent of the great american blue artist like johnson and skip james and yet it is something else something other something more these short song are constructed of drake 's idiosyncratic guitar and melancholy lyric that are not quite circular but softer more introspective and i 'd dare say organic and only because nick drake is so different and also because his expression are all earthy morning moon sun star yet like the blue these tune have deeply personal theme borne of individual pain not really orpheus wooing eurydice with a guitar a the rolling stone album guide call it it 's more rustic than that celtic but still timelessly dreamy ethereal and yes a bit spooky pink moon is an artist fully realizing his potential and expressing it ephemeral romantic insidiously charming alluringly poetic pink moon is the record that music lover eventually find will find should find in their dreamscape unforgettable and indescribable this soft lilting record is of a voice not really like anyone you 've heard before and wo n't hear again unless you know or have known the dark angel murmuring in your dream night 

nick drake did not record a bad album during his all too brief life this is his darkest effort the sound stripped down to mainly his own guitar and quiet voice it is clearly a product of a great mental anguish someone fighting their daemon barely able to function the lyric are le lush and hopeful than earlier effort the arrangement starker overall a bleaker surreal mood that match the album cover the album showcase his guitar virtuosity drenched in melancholy and alienation it is impossible to listen to this album and not feel for this man 

nick drake ha become the darling of the soundtrack set his song have been used in the film serendipity garden state dream with the fish and the royal tenenbaums a well a in a volkswagen commercial pretty amazing for a guy who achieved no real commercial success while he wa active and ha now been dead for over 30 year pink moon wa the last album drake recorded it 's a haunting experience to listen to it now with the benefit of hindsight knowing that the artist wa only a couple year from taking his own life though many will argue whether his death wa a suicide or just an accidental overdose according to drake 's producer engineer john wood pink moon wa laid down late at night over two evening in early 1972 and featured almost no overdubs the track average roughly two minute in length and the whole thing clock in under half an hour but the brevity and immediacy only add to the emotional impact the more complex arrangement that marked drake 's first two album five leaf left and bryter layter are gone what remains are nick 's soft wistful voice his guitar and a little piano piece on the title track the album is drenched in loneliness disconnection and the hard earned advice of someone who wa learning the difficult lesson of a world with which he could not cope it is also dotted with sign of drake 's desire to depart this life the four line lyric to know sound an awful lot like a goodbye note at the same time track such a from the morning reveal someone still able to find beauty and hope around him even if he wa only finding it for others and not for himself i 'd single out other song but pink moon is a collective experience the perfect essence of folk music and a sorrowful portrait of a young man in the grip of an emotional state that he could not master a he mastered his art i think few would argue that the best music is honest and offer u a look inside the performer pink moon certainly meet that description providing a window into an injured soul at time it 's almost painful to listen but at the same time it 's too magically beautiful to turn off 

i too wa shocked and amazed and a little saddened to hear nick 's pink moon used to shill for automobile and i ca n't help but wonder what people will make of this if they buy it because of the tv ad this could most accurately be described a quot uneasy listening quot on a par with neil young 's quot tonight 's the night quot and i would instead recommend bryter layter for the uninitiated however this is my personal favorite drake lp so yes buy this one too so you can discover what a very select few have known for year that nick drake wa a major talent and the world is a poorer place for his passing 

this wa nick drake 's final album before his 1974 overdose it 's not even a half hour long but in that short amount of time he created some of the most emotional challenging somber and thought provoking song just with an acoustic guitar and his voice not to forget that piano line in pink moon 7 count em 7 song on this album made me cry the title track place to be road which will thing behind the sun parasite and from the morning that say a lot on how moving and harrowing an album can be nick drake certainly had a gift of finding the right guitar chord to trigger someone 's button and of finding the right vocal tone that are not too quiet but not loud either his near whisper resonates so loudly that it stick in not only your mind but also your heart and even your blood while some either scream at the top of their lung out to get their point across and others use wall of sound tyo capture an essence drake expressed more emotion on this album than linkin park ever will and moved me to other dimension in music more than jimi hendrix although hendrix ha always been a god to me it 's a tragedy that drake went unnoticed during his lifetime which only add to the mystique of this album and his entire catalogue but thankfully people are discovering him 28 year after his untimely death and his music will definitely live on for century the 2 best word to describe his music ephemeral and ethereal he might 've only released 3 album but those 3 album are some of the greatest ever this one is the best one this one is definitely in my top 10 for best album ever buy it now 

it 's hard to explain to someone why you like nick drake people either hear the unique talent or they do n't to say he ha a cult following today is an understatement in all his song there is a soft gentle vocal wrapped around an intricate guitar arrangement 2 of the better example of this would be the title cut and place to be listening to his music all these year later it 's hard to see how radio missed this wonderful artist 

this album exists in a precarious balance it is clearly the record of it artist 's descent into paralyzing melancholia but it record that arc so beautifully it lack of ornamentation which may alienate some new listener is also it greatest virtue this structural clarity allows the subtle lyric to shine through once neglected with the rest of drake 's body of work this album is now rightly regarded a a rediscovered classic in the unlikely event you do n't already know this album it wa his last studio album recorded by drake alone with his guitar he later added some piano flourish to the title track this allows him freedom to explore his vision and he prof quite the guitarist the intricate arrangement on free ride for instance contrast with the austere sound of know an unvarying railroad shuffle with no dynamic variation powered instead by drake 's high lonesome wail his lyrical theme appears to be that he care deeply but can do no more than he already ha the deeply fatalistic structure of his verse come across in line like this from road you can take the road that take you to the star nowi can take the road that 'll see me throughhe 's granting his listener the freedom to go on even though he belief he 's turning them loose on a fool 's errand similarly from harvest breed falling fast and falling free you look to find a friendfalling fast and falling free this could just be the endthe collation of freedom with finality seems remarkably dark at first blush the moment you 're free you will die but consider it from the other angle the moment you die you 're free death need not mean bodily death though a in the tarot death may mean any sudden change the end of an old way and the commencement of a new death then is not scary and it 's not final nick drake scare some listener because he is n't bound by the stricture of cultural normalcy if you know anything of his life he may not have even been aware that such stricture even existed he speaks an argot that doe not bend to the whim of fashion but if you like music with an edge and lyric which speak perceived truth then the very trait that alienate nick drake from some listener will endear him to you 

nick drake wa a tortured soul but sometimes it seems the most beautiful work come from angst this album 's greatness lie in the simplicity nick drake and a guitar and a tad of piano saturday morning with some coffee and this cd make me feel so relaxed from the morning is probably my favorite but that can vary a well the entire cd is only about 28 minute probably the most melancholy 28 minute ever recorded 

in the throe of a depression that would see him dead at the age of 26 from an overdose of anti depression medication nick drake still managed to produce his last album pink moon unlike his first two effort which consisted of orchestrated folk pop music this 1972 album wa just drake playing his acoustic guitar and singing with a bit of piano here and there the result is a bleak testament to melancholy and alienation that ha a haunting and pristine beauty there are only eleven song most of which are under three minute in length which is why the album is not even a half hour long but there is a sense in which anything longer would be too much to bear pink moon by itself justifies drake 's status a a cult figure among those who love folk rock ironically you have probably hear nick drake 's music before because the title track wa used for a volkswaggen commercial just another example of how music is perverted to commercial interest what else is new i have been spending the cold winter putting together mix of folk music in the broadest sense and making a concerted effort to get beyond bob dylan and the byrd to explore the like of sandy denny and the beau brummels checking out sandy denny led me to fairport convention and richard thompson and eventually to ralph mctell and nick drake now i can only wonder what rock i have been living under that i have never come across these artist before the title track is a beautiful folk ballad performed with just drake 's superb acoustic guitar playing and haunting vocal throughout the album you notice the depth of his lyric and his guitar playing the latter might have been lost in an album with orchestration but here you have the opportunity to listen to the opening of radio and parasite unadorned for the former a choice example would be the opening of what is probably the best song on the album it is hard to choose which will which begin which will you go for which will you love which will you choose from from the star above there is a simple elegance to the lyric captured by the vocal and complimented by the more complex guitar playing nick drake only produced three album so there is no reason not to have all of them in your music library these work represent the very best of the british folk rock scene and drake is a first rate singer songwriter whose song of failed romance mortality and depression are quite affective drake intended pink moon to be his final album saying he had nothing left to record when you lose yourself listening to these song you can actually convince yourself that this wa true 

i have listened to pink moon again for the first time in a year in fact i let it cycle through three time feeling compelled to try and grasp the fleeting music before it fade away to silence for this at time the music of quiet perhaps it is the vocal often a hoarse whisper that cannot compete even with the solo acoustic guitar or perhaps the hollow wisdom of youth trying to lament honestly life 's shortcoming there are moment of unfathomable insight and heartbreak encapsulated here the title track is a delight but the interplay of piano and guitar make me yearn for more instead of le so that after a few song with just guitar and vocal my attention drift each flow and meld into the next never quite forging a separate identity one extended thought shrouded in neither black nor white but a gray hazy and vague still the effect for me is much like trying to make a meal from a stash of communion wafer each song usher in a promise of something more something beyond the pall but few fully satisfy i prefer his other work on five leaf left and bryter later desolation and isolation may permeate the song but mr drake still displayed his mastery of the acoustic guitar with a touch and flair that both keep the whole recording from drowning in melancholy and testify to his considerable talent hence pink moon seems a a fitting requiem for nick drake 

the thought of nick drake being so depressed that his life would end at the tender young age of 26 is itself to me a sobering and depressing fact about how hard life can be while nick drake may not have been able to cope with life it is also clear to me that his wa a gentle and sensitive poet 's soul listening to this his most stark recording you come directly in contact with nick drake 's very soul and this soul life on the record is thus haunting and beautiful i'm no religious fanatic but i cannot help but think that the sheer depth of the music of nick drake and of pink moon in particular hint at a realm of the spiritual there is simply something in this drake 's quiet guitar strumming his mournful singing the overall simplicity of the arrangement that is not unlike the moment of contemplation that one sometimes experience while sitting in a holy place be it a church or a chapel or even a small natural pond surrounded by nature and which is thus transcendent in fact a ian mcdonald 's sympathetic mojo article exiled from heaven argues nick drake wa n't a literal disciple of blake or buddha there are no direct blake reference in his lyric nor is he likely to have treated buddhism a more than a confirmation of concept he 'd arrived at through his own experience nevertheless blake 's mystical vision and the tenet of buddhism illuminate a great deal of his work drake 's outlook seems to have boiled down to the linked recognition that life is a predicament and that the world is ultimately an irreducible mystery to u why it exists why we exist in it why there is anything at all we have n't the slightest idea from this sense of predicament and mystery flow all his work and also his message to u more than that the same influence shaped the growth and decline of his life the article add about drake 's vocal that it is a low close sustained sound rich in chest vibration yet entirely without glamorous vibrato it 's the sound of incantation slow deep om like his phrasing is riverine flowing across metre and through bar line a though detached from normal time it 's a if he 's seeking to impress upon u the sense of another way of being looking at and considering such element of this music it is obvious that there is more here than a quick consideration might recognize it is perhaps these various element which make this music so rich and which for me at least cause it to become ever more satisfying with each subsequent listen i just know that i 'll be listening to nick drake for the rest of my life i ca n't say that with confidence about too many musician 

i wa a latecomer into nick drake 's music a many other people i re discovered him thanks to the medium hype of recent time and boy am i happy i did nick drake 's music combine the best element of folk and brit psychodelia when i listen to drake besides entering a peaceful state where i feel in perfect communion with the rest of the universe i remember music from jeff buckley elliott smith both no longer among u a well rufus wainwright and even cat stevens sad thing how after thirty year of his passing a commercial may bring his music back to life some say me i feel it 's all just fine nick 's posthumous album brings 1972 all back with one mellow tune after another in 2004 or any other year you choose to play it making it the perfect soundtrack to ride to and back from work write to or quite simply sit back and let go 

nick drake 's is one of the many sad story from the world of music he wa signed by a record company when he wa just 20 released three album went into seclusion and then died from overdosing on antidepressant a death which wa officially ruled a suicide his music wa well received by those who actually heard it but partially due to his refusal to perform live or really do anything publicly it never really sold well until many year later when the title track from this his final album appeared in a car commercial i instantly recognized it once the vocal started up although i ca n't say whether it 's the commercial or just hearing it on the radio in any case it 's the beginning of one of the best folk album i 've heard in my limited experience and certainly still worth listening today except for a bit of piano on pink moon the entire recording is just a half hour of nick with his voice and a guitar it 's apparently easily his sparsest release but i found myself nevertheless enjoying what he wa able to do with such a limited range of sound he pluck and strum his way through eleven similar but distinct enough song many of which portray all too vividly the personal issue and depression that likely led to his early death there 's place to be in which he already seems morose over his long gone youth at the ripe old age of 24 and then there 's which will where he seems to ask a woman who she 'll love if not him and who can forget parasite a title that conjures an image of a despicable loathsome pest and is in reference to nick himself and despite all this self negativity there 's a simple beauty to the music itself that somehow make the whole thing even more depressing it 's not the most interesting album i 've ever heard but it 's one of the most emotionally affecting and definitely worth a visit for anyone interested in the genre 

quot pink moon quot is one of the saddest and most beautiful album put to tape quot road quot quot horn quot quot thing behind the sun quot and quot parasite quot are the sad song otherwise i think the album ha more of a bittersweet feel to it sure nick drake wa melancholy and depressed but he wa able to find beauty in it and make pure art out of it all this is my favorite nick drake album because it is so pure with no string attached literally just his voice and his guitar and a little twinkle of piano in quot pink moon quot and the brevity of it all is so amazing drake say all he need to say and i wa n't thirsting for more sure i would have loved to hear more of nick 's song but i do n't think the album would have had a much of an impact on me more song and album should be this way it seems so many album now and even back then thrived on excess and nick 's guitar playing really shine through he wa an exceptionally skilled guitarist and he us unique tuning on most of the song on this record his way of guitar playing ha also shown influence on some of today 's folk troubadour like elliott smith another disciple of despair misery and heartbreak a far a the volkswagen cabrio commercial go i do n't look on it a a bad thing at all so everybody should just stop their whining it 's bringing nick 's music to a wider audience and i had n't heard of him until a year and a half ago so i feel very grateful nick drake wa one of the most talented singer songwriter and his music is a true work of art 

of course it is you know that my first exposure to a nick drake songwas sebadoh 's cover of pink moonback in the 90 's for whatever reason i didnt really listen to nick himselfuntil 2007 when i wa working at night by myselflistening to a playlist of hundred of song made by other coworkers and this record came on the speaker i think id always known id get it eventually i think i had to grow up alot to really get it now i feel i do more and more a short perfect quiet melancholy record very little going on nothing but what 's absolutely necessary anyway get it if you love music 

the most popular and probably widest revered of his catalog nick drake 's pink moon is a stripped down guitar and voice record with only occasional overdubbed piano in response to this the production is much drier than on previous album lending a natural fragility to the record rather than the warmth on the previous two album the album ha a sparseness to it emphasized further by it short length but a great power a well i do n't think it quite the masterpiece it often thought of a i 'd reserve that for drake 's debut five leaf left it is a fine album what it excels at is being delicate check the instrumental horn a simpel and beautiful guitar line or the famous pink moon featured in a volkswagon commercial and the stunning thing behind the sun the material is brilliant it just that there 's not terribly a lot of it and some of it would have benefited from a stronger production and arrangement still it a beautiful album and well worth investigation recommended 

this is a quiet haunting intimate sparse spooky lulling uneasy album by one of the greatest previously undiscovered talent of the 1970s the sound is so simple and spare you might not even hear it if it 's on and you 're not paying attention but if you give it your full attention you 'll find yourself being overpowered and falling in love all of nick drake 's album are good but this one on which he strip away everything unneeded strip away all the sappy smooth jazz saxophone or unnecessary string and leaf only a defeated yet hopeful voice a masterfully fingerpicked lo fi guitar and a piano note here and there is his most cohesive coherent perfect album if this were the only thing he had ever recorded his name would live in music history forever if this were the only album you ever bought your money would not have been wasted every one of these song evoke emotion you will feel dark night empty parking lot foot crunching through gravel lost love and time you can never go back to you will feel like you know nick drake personally and that feeling wo n't be wrong 

i listen to alot of music and performer song writer i 've read review of nick drake for awhile now and thought i have to get his cd 's and check him out so i bought a copy of pink moon i 've listened to it many of time now to try and get what lot of other people are getting from him but to no avail i'm sorry but it 's just a lame cd to me i'm going to stick with the more dynamic songwriting nick nick cave 

pink moon wa the third and last album that nick drake managed to get released in his all too short lifetime the album differs somewhat from the previous two first and foremost through the fact that the song are only accompanied by drake himself on his acoustic guitar apart from the title track which ha a nice little piano line also played by drake the song are generally simple and short and in some case they may seem a little unfinished with only one verse and a slightly raw sound on the guitar drake 's well known and strong songwriting is present on most track and when a first disappointment may have subsided you will discover several fine song on a par with drake 's very best the title track pink moon is perhaps the easiest to tune to fall for a very melodic and catchy song ywhich you may easily find yourself go humming a nice variation with the nice piano part there is a of the first two album a sad undertone to most song this applies not least place to be one of the few song with longer lyric road is a nice little song that could well sound like a donovan song which will is also a song that win on closer acquaintance while horn is a nice little instrumental which showcase drake 's original guitar style thing behind the sun is another of the album highlight a song which seems completely finished unlike the next track know which in both sound and form appears rather unfinished a little bluesy thing the sad mood get an extra shot with parasite also one of the most memorable song free ride may also appear a little unfinished but still quite charming another fine donovan like song b harvest breed is a very short little song with just a single verse it ha a fine typical drake melody from the morning is a worthy end to a nice little album which may nevertheless appear somewhat unresolved and one can easily come to feel that the album could have deserved a little more time in the creation process and maybe a little variation in the arrangement the cover art though is by far the most interesting among drake 's three album 

nick drake pink moon 1 2pink moon is one of the most alluring album in the history of music both dark and ominous and yet somehow either hit you a a incredibly hopeful piece of music or the bleakest track listing this side of big star third album with songwriting so sharp and poetic it drive you nut and encapsulates you with each listen acoustic guitar work to write home about combining to make a sheer classic pink moon is an album for all time mood and most importantly all collection 

this album is the most perfect 30 minute you could buy it is one whole suite not individual song each new song intensifying the last pink moon open and come a a warning quot it gonna get you all quot what follows are song that capture emotion indescribable pure blue horn is minimal to say the least single note express thought clearly the last 3 song are my favorite drake 's guitar playing is excellent on these i cannot imagine how it is just him playing one acoustic guitar and thats it there is so much more going on his finger picking and the tone that he get from his guitar are almost impossible to replicate combined with his voice and lyrical interplay it just brilliant listening to this record is like a wiping clean all stress and problem in your life pure and simple melody to soothe your soul 

do n't get me wrong by the title of this review i love this cd this is the most depressing cd nick ha done let alone any one ha done but i never felt depress because i listine to it it is amazing that he managed to record these song consdering that he check his self in a metal instution shortly after finishing this album it is also one of the few cd with only a voice and guitar that i can listen too alot of time 

nick is a recent discovery for me needle to say it 's a much welcome discovery drake 's vocal are haunting and beautiful the style is vintage sounding yet distinct the guitar playing is magnificent if you are looking for something to fill certain void in your modern folk music file look no further nick drake fill the gap very nicely 

nick drake 's pink moon is roughly thirty minute long it 's worth ca n't be measured in minute how doe one measure the pure poetry of a young man 's last stand time ca n't reflect a sadness darker than the deepest sea a lone voice and single guitar have never said more pink moon is timeless 

apparently a lot of modern young musician have looked to nick drake for inspiration that sense of despair that sense of loneliness irrelevance that kind of thing maybe that 's one reason why they walk around like tramp loud mouthed and stupid the search for individuality ha surely drifted into the hand of ignorant swine by pink moon stage nick drake had drifted into isolation and heavy depression but the sound of pink moon is not crushingly depressing nor is it tediously claustrophobic the album ha an overall quality of sound some bit are higher tempo and so more uplifting the instrument playing is precise like drake 's voice carrying the listener over desolate hill and stillwater beach i ca n't really pick out the highlight because it 's like taking the chick away from the mother hen pink moon is worth more than a listen it deserves to be thought of a a beautiful melancholic classic on anybody 's list 

this album is just guitar and voice with a smattering of piano here and there it contains classic like radio which will and the well known title track know is almost bluesy with it simple guitar and haunting voice while the jangling guitar of parasite ha an almost hypnotic quality ride ha a lovely pop melody and ha been covered by other artist i think from the morning is another pastoral gem although delectable in it minimalist elegance pink moon is not my favourite nick drake album i just enjoy his voice more with a fuller instrumental backing still this remains a minimalist classic 

nick drake 's final album pink moon wa recorded over the span of two day unlike his first two album which contained backing of string woodwind and keyboard pink moon is stripped down to bone mr drake 's expressive guitar take center stage and the bleak arrangement feed the depressive lyric the title ha become famous thanks to it inclusion in a volkswagon but it is only one of many stellar track quot thing behind the sun quot quot from the morning quot quot road quot quot harvest breed quot and quot rise quot all contain dark brooding deep and thought provoking lyric that show a man with clear inner demon 

in 1972 nick drake just twenty four year old felt beaten the cambridge singer songwriter 's two previous lp although excellent had gained little attention and a severe case of clinical depression wa clouding his emotion now it wa time for drake to reluctantly enter a studio and fulfill his three record contract with island record the resulting work pink moon is one of those rare occurrence when a genuine sense of dread and sadness saturates through the recording studio wire and unto tape captivating more focused and dedicated listener a mild mannered drake recorded these eleven song clocking in le than thirty minute with just an acoustic guitar and his delicate beatific voice where his previous album found nick 's song backed with a think layer of accompaniment the music doe not suffer in the least though drake 's sturdy guitar strumming always his secret weapon make this some of the lushest music ever recorded with only an acoustic guitar pink moon is a superb album containing much of the best of drake 's brand of starry heartfelt song including the sentimental yet fearful title track the bleak quot place to be quot and the touching quot from the morning quot yet drake explores some distinctly new teritory with the paranoiac quot parasite quot and the rhythmic quot free ride quot and quot harvest breed quot when finished with pink moon nick left the master tape on island record 's reception desk and quietly walked away remorsefully withdrawing from the music business sadly his death from an overdose of anti depressant followed two year later nick drake never realized what an exceptional young talent he truly wa this album stand a the most emotional bare boned reason why he so underestimated himself 

i like pretty much anyone who ha gotten into nick drake 's music in the past year or two found out about him from the volkswagen cabrio commercial i fell in love with the song and pretty soon i wa on trying to find more and more of his song pretty soon i just bought the album and gave the entire thing a listen pink moon the title track is definitely one of the best song on the album but it is not the best thing behind the sun is in my opinion the best track on the album every time i hear it i get chill down my spine especially the last two line and the movement in your brain sends you out into the rain every song on this album is a gem from start to finish my only problem is that it 's only about 28 minute long i wish he could 've put more song on it but that is only a very minor problem and i only wish nick drake were still alive today to see that his dream really did come true nevertheless at least i can still enjoy his music from all four album and treasure them forever 

thanks to the magic of the internet i wa able to listen to pink moon many time legally and it 's the most stripped down album i 've ever heard a sound system wo n't do anything to enhance the music there is no hidden melody and what you hear on the surface is all you get it doe n't get more stripped down than this only one song feature a piano which is the title track everything else just consists of nick drake his acoustic guitar and his thought really doe n't sound very interesting i know yet this is the exact essence of one of the meaning of music putting your thought and emotion into music nick drake never felt more stark and empty so he recorded this everything show that in pink moon yet while it is empty there is a beautiful emotion behind it the right place for this to be listened to is in nature nowhere else will pink moon will click heck just try blending this album with the ambience of a forest focus on the music and what he 's saying with the beauty of nature itself totally amazing i get the same feeling listening to this a the same feeling when i sit on a porch in the forest with nothing but nature getting this emotion you just ca n't feel why listen to the music that make me feel this kind of emotion in the place it conjures sound great to me the music of course will always stand on it 's own no matter where you are when listening to this you will forget people and be with yourself drake 's guitar playing is pretty catchy too he can make a good melody with his guitar and it doe seem to fit the lyric well it 's a great thing he make good guitar line with plenty of melody because it 's the only thing it is truly some beauty in this and the melody are never boring just beautiful thanks to that along with his excellent voice he creates something that will hook you from beginning to end for people who want some music a pure a possible buy this album nuff said 9 10 

nick drake pink moonnick drake guitar pianoproducerthat 's all who wa in the studio in the time of making this acoustic classic how can such beauty come from such raw element i can tell you because nick drake had talent and he presented himself well in his vocal his guitar playing and his lyricsyeah to some people the lyric may sound naive and childlike but to me they are simple for a fact of getting a point across and the instrumental horn is a superb track in a middle of a masterpieceafter you 've got this get five leaf left feature the classic river man 

i found this album in a used lp bin in 1990 i bought it because the cover wa cool at first listen i wa unimpressed it sounded so bare so basic nonetheless i found myself listening to the record again and again until i suddenly realized i had come to love it a few year later i picked up quot fruit tree quot which included everything nick drake had ever recorded on 4 cd 's pink moon remained my favorite after experiencing the spare delicate arrangement of quot pink moon quot it wa hard to relate to the horn and string n quot bryter layter quot and quot five leaf left quot the song are great on those two record but i feel the production hopelessly date them just the other day being an obesessive about sound quality i bought the new 24 bit remaster of this album the new cd sound at least a good a the old lp although in honesty my copy wa neither an early pressing on anywhere near mint inner detail are subtly revealed drake 's voice ha more quot air quot around it you can discern the character more readily the music itself of course remains utterly essential the lyric are spooky the guitar playing is intricate for all the talk about this being a quot dificult quot album i feel it is actually very accesible it is melodic gorgeously wrought full of mystery and at time full of joy 

i'm not sure why i'm writing this if 199 review with an average of 5 star apiece 4 8 if you get technical about it did n't convince you i'm not sure what more i can say but here go there have been few album in artist that have made such a beautiful account of standing on the edge of being depressed disillusioned longing and sheer loneliness yes nick drake encapsulates all these emotion so simply and so poignantly in a mere 26 minute with only shimmering accoustic guitar to accompany him his lyricism is powerful his poetry is romantic his voice is angelic and his guitar play is a virtuosic a they come and when he sang he sang a if he meant everything he wrote he sang with desparation when he sang oh so weak in the palest blue so weak in this need for you with bitterness when he sang know that i love you know that i'm not there and with sadness when he sang i am the parasite of your town and he did n't need a single distortion pedal amp a band or even a pick there is no filter from the thing in his heart to the mic just him so those of watch tragic movie lamented with dylan when he sang not dark yet listen to norah jones and jack johnson and folk and blue or any other music that sings of inner frustration or play an accoustic guitar for that matter you needto hear pink moon badly note nick drake 's music overall is n't a depressed a some would lead you to believe if this is too disturbed for you bryter layter might be more to your liking but get five leaf left too no matter which one you buy first you 'll want the other two a soon a you hear it 

no creo que tanta belleza melancolia soledad y fragilidad puedan nuevamente encerrarse en solo 30 minutos esta obra de arte excede el formato cancion son solo treinta minutos poesia fracturada musica exuisita sencilla y simple e imprescindible la escucha de este disco ma no se puede decir no dejes de escucharlo please 

nick drake 's third and most stripped down album is music at it most elemental state one guitar played without a pick one totally naked voice the only extra is a few piano note scattered throughout the title track this album wa recorded in 1972 but that matter not emotion and music this pure could 've been made 100 year ago or yesterday drake 's hushed voice and lyric are full of loneliness despair regret and alienation parasite and the title track especially but there 's a current of hope and introspection throughout that redeems it from pale sad sack whining raw and real very autumnal music and drake 's underrated playing never disappoints it never feel studied or dry just an endless cascade of pastoral strumming and shimmering melody in particular horn know and in the morning are amazing both in their simple yet eloquent songcraft and enchanting guitar line this is one short album only 28 minute total with the longest song measuring shy of four minute but it remains unsurpassed in it minimalist elegance play this for uneducated folk who think that sensitive male acoustic fratboy crap like john mayer is the be all end all and watch the amazement on their face totally essential and one of my favorite album regardless of genre 

i own 3 copy of this cause i'm concerned that i might lose the first two 28 wonderful minute of music that will stand the test of time it ha been said many time before but it bares repeating this is a masterpiece a place where hope life wrapped in a dark curtain 

this is le of a review and more of a sonic comparison to the two pink moon lp i own i own this latest remastering and the simply vinyl reissue the new one is more transparent guitar strum have nice tone and resonance transient response is greater overall i'm glad i decided to purchase this latest remastering from a great artist 

i do n't mean that title in a bad way but there 's an undeniable dark hour of the night feeling throughout this album 's 28 minute pink moon is certainly nick drake 's saddest and darkest work but ultimately the most timeless where bryter layter can sound slightly dated and over orchestrated i say the simple power of one good voice and a guitar will never age this album could have been recorded in 1971 or tomorrow someone below used the phrase pleasantly melancholy and i entirely agree beautiful though short the longest track thing behind the sun clock in at a whopping 3 56 yet nice and moody this is the kind of music that can make you cry and then make you glad you did hope come and go here never really joyful but never really gone the title track perhaps a precursor to the harbinger of doom black eyed dog which only surfaced after nick 's death seems a recognition of an omen with almost a weary acceptance we go out on a positive note in from the morning but that blend of pleasantness and sorrow never really leaf if you 're reading this chance are you know and love the treasure that is his music already for someone who ha n't heard any drake before i 'd recommend the debut five leaf left there 's a single disc compilation way to blue but once you get addicted you 'll only want to buy them all anyway pink moon is about nick drake and about all of u one of those rare work that truly speaks to something in everyone 

when i first saw and heard quot pink moon quot one of my favorite song for many year being used in a volkswagen commercial my first thought wa quot oh cool nick drake 's music is finally being brought to the mass quot believe me i 've seen many example of great song being tarnished forever by being used in a bad commercial but this is n't one of them the song is used tastefully and respectfully nick drake largely shunned human contact so he would probably have approved of the commercial 's depiction of 4 kid who decide they 'd rather just drive around on a starry night than go to some party and get wasted and laid i 'd also say that judging from the fact that a 28 year old record is 12 mar 27 on the amazon best seller list that the song is just a much a commercial for nick drake a it is for volkswagen think of the power of a 30 second snippet of a song without any information about the artist people have searched out this deceased man 's music wanting to hear it again my hope is that these neophyte nick drake fan will listen beyond the title track and discover just what an amazing album quot pink moon quot really is that song is just one of an amazing collection recorded by a man in extreme despair with lyric that appear to be out of some poet 's feverish dream maybe they 'll then move on to drake 's other wonderful album and hey if it took a car commercial for this to happen so be it 

i bought a nick drake album once before amp wa really disappointed by the arrangement lot of string could n't really listen to it then i picked up pink moon wow this is what all the fuss is about unique acoustic mellow amp beautiful if you are at all interested in nick drake get pink moon first amp you 'll be hooked this is a great album amp i 've got to admit that it wa that vw add that made me give nick drake another shot really a mellow classic 

yes this is a sad and eerie record i must admit that i prefer the first two nick drake album but this is a fine album in it own right my favorite song are thing behind the sun and parasite know is also excellent a weird little blue cut with ominous and powerful strumming by drake and a few deceptively simple word a majestic and rather creepy release from perhaps the greatest of the late 60 's early 70 singer songwriter and a always his voice arrangement and word are eerie haunting and touching highly recommended 

the entire album consists of one man an acoustic guitar and a little bit of piano most of the song do n't top 3 minute and the whole thing doe n't top 30 the album probably cost le to record than most artist spend on room service at the hilton heck there 's even a couple of mistake here and there in the guitar playing and yet despite all this i have absolutely no hesitation whatsoever in saying that this is one of the most brilliant and complete album ever made what nick drake did on this album is just monumental and despite it super exiguous nature this album just ha so much to it and prof to be more and more rewarding with time nick wa no virtuoso musician by any mean but he wa an awe inspiring songwriter who knew how to entrance your sens with a simple 2 minute song his distinctive smoky voice just had an indescribable warmth and coziness to it that perfectly complemented his entrancing guitar melody he also doe a magnificent job of keeping the songwriting interesting and diverse with an album like this it could potentially become monotonous but not so here from the bouncy free ride to the dark and haunting thing behind the sun to the infectious piano adorned title track there are plenty of different mood shade and texture to keep you listening and keep you coming back this is a great album for driving through the countryside or sitting in front of the fireplace on a cold night or just hanging around doing nothing in particular this is just a really spectacular and timeless piece of music nick drake 's career may have been brief his ending tragic his success too late but with pink moon he ha made a bigger impact than he or anyone else could ever have imagined 

you can take a road that take you to the star i can take a road that 'll see me through a the lyric to the beautiful road ring you ca n't help but feel the sadness of pink moon moment of sanguinity and sens of cynical optimism cut through the bleak overtone but they are ominously tinted by the reality of drake 's impending suicide certainly the legacy of a suicidal musician is nothing new but while half hearted self loathing singer songwriter surrounded in their glorification of depression emulate drake 's altar one must take pink moon for what it is one of the very best folk album ever made throughout the album drake weave a master class in acoustic guitar playing utilising alternative tuning and complex delicate finger picking all produced through a wonderfully warm tone the sound is sparse unlike five leaf left or bryter layter there are no orchestrated section nor even a piano in the mix it is stripped down raw and lonely and this act well to emphasise the stellar writing especially with such outstanding song a thing behind the sun pink moon road and free ride some of the most delicate and haunting music drake ever created it is unfortunately a very short album almost equalling a lengthy ep and that is my one qualm it is rightly heralded a one of the greatest folk singer songwriter album 

this album had such a reputation that i could not miss it what i must say this is not for people who enjoy bubblegum hummable top 40 tune or most other people i'm sad to say the song are tuneless melancholic droning without any distinct structure pink moon is the only redeemable track nick drake the 'tortured' genius the legend ha become intertwine with his music so that it not his talent alone but the sad story of his premature death which ha carried this decidedly mediocre record if you 're into depressing music then elliott smith offer much more listenable fare at least his song have beautiful melody harmony instrumentals etc 

there 's music in the air and oh yeah the music can be heard from across the waterway the lagoon it procrastinates out over the buffet table and the bar and the dessert table through the lanai and over the gentle undertow where the bridge cross over the rustling of the green swamp water grass the reminiscing of the beauty of the life of music lingers on it wa early and people began to drift in at a slow and leisurely pace freshly showered perfumed lazy day of life sustain without regret white linen pant and summer dress all year round the employee came first then the aroma of mesquite grilled abundance which wa professionally marinated and cooked full moon for the party goer smoked out over the embankment slow cooking a whole day process in homage to this very night then came the young fresh energetics more than ready and willing to celebrate the beauty of their existence their diversity their life on this planet the language of the music wa not always their own but the emotion of their music wa universal there wa mingling laughing and frivolous celebration of good thing in life yet to come her real name is betty but we call her june and when it wa all said and done couple walked slowly away from there hand in hand stopping every once in a while with their eye glazed over to make a point of remembering that particular moment in time they had said quot we should really do this more often quot and meant it tristan tom 

this album is pretty good the singer 's voice for whatever reason reminds me of a softer version of cat stevens the music is slower quieter and melancholy the arrangement are just him and a guitar with a bit of piano on the title track if this came out today it 'd probably be labelled sadcore my only real complaint is that the album is a little short and i felt there could be a bit more accompaniment the piano on the title track is nice that 's just a matter of taste i guess i enjoy this album nonetheless it 's relaxing and i enjoy going for a walk during the evening with this on 

who wa nick drake what motivated him why can you never tell from his singing what mood he wa in those tuning where did he get them from what did his friend think of him these question need answering this music is a emotionality devastating and powerful a joy division why on the surface we have beautiful melodic structure rendered on acoustic guitar with unorthodox progression on top is the velvety voice rather middle class which never even attempt to `project' or `emote' the key seems to be that nick drake realised something important that surface structure and deep structure are orthogonal you can express the deepest despair in the prettiest of way joy division and nick drake totally different surface structure same deep structure it 's not always true `which will' ha a gorgeous detuning which make the guitar sound like a harp small triplet sound in the treble the bass string take you down with them the shape of the music it progression ha some of the finality of joy division 's `new dawn fades' but then again it 's cheerful like mozart cheerful and sad at the same time during `pink moon' nick sings `saw it written and i saw it say' only you 'd swear it wa a strangely accented `saw it written and suicide' this music is undateable you would not be surprised to hear `1965' or `2005' or anything in between like `bryter layter' this music is extremely sophisticated formally advanced durable and totally enigmatic it would sound at home in a wine bar why doe it make you want to cry where is the emotion exactly being expressed this music is an object lesson to the emoters of which there have been far too many in rock it is extraordinarily subtle and make nonsense of aesthetic theory that try to relate form to content and which rock star implicitly recognise no flangers no chorus effect no big drum no grunge screaming for title like `parasite' and `harvest breed' nick drake tap and express fundamental emotion which rock music doe n't often go near with any real success thing like beauty of day loveliness of weather and girlfriend how do you survive lost love what do you do when you hate yourself what happens when the world doe not accept you he wa some kind of genius at rendering these thing i am still trying to work out exactly what sort rip nick 

this is actually one of the most relaxing album i 've ever heard quot pink moon quot is ideal for 3am listening when the world is quiet and still and you want to be alone with your thought the gorgeous title track quot place to be quot and the instrumental quot horn quot are my current favorite but everthing here is so beautifully sung and simply played singling out any favorite is kind of beside the point one can actually hear drake slowly coming unraveled emotionally a he sings and sometimes mutter his disquieting and somewhat caustic lyric the fact that he died not long after this wa released add a certain poignance to these proceeding but one leaf away from quot pink moon quot feeling refreshed and invigorated sort of like having a new lease on life just dim some light lie down on a big fluffy pillow and let nick take you by the hand and lead you into the ether you 'll never be the same again bonus the guitar playing here is a marvel of simplicity r i p nick drake you were a visionary 

pink moon nick drake 's final album before his unfortunate death is a masterpiece recorded during midnight session on consecutive night nick drake sat in a studio with himself and producer joe boyd the only thing that accompanies drake 's voice is the silent playing of his acoustic guitar and piano on the title track pink moon a drake plunged deeper into depression he expressed himself by recording the bleak pink moon which stand today a one of the most underrated album by one of the most underrated singer songwirters in history recommended 

bobby goldsboro wa one of my favorite from the 60 's all quality music very worth the investment for those who like the music of the 60 's 

let me tell you about this wierd coincidence one of my favorate song and one of my most hated song have the same title honey i really lothe the sap of bobby goldsboro 's 1968 death smash yet the sensual ohio player smashhoneyis one of my favortate number punch the mouse on the link and i have a review on that too but this is ahead of our story for year bobby 's honey creeped me out and i am not sure why maybe it is that strange female voice that stalk up behind our widower maybe it is the creepiness of this hick death lulluby that tried to be so cute at the hight of vietnam and race riot not realizing it own inharent morbidness maybe my nrusery school teacher liked it maybe i heard it on 1969 am radio a a baby when something trumatic wa happening to me total speculation dad snuck a transistor radio into my crib so i could hear the beatles and i got this maybe that 's the problem or maybe the song suck fan sorry go buy an ohio player album but after all this i am not dismissing bobby entirely i somehow obtained some of his lp on one of those 100 for fifty buck deal i sometimes find and i have noticed some of the uptempo number have a nice spiral staircase horn feel not exactly charlie mingus but not badnow let 's move onto the other honey this one ha something over on bobby 's she doe not die sorry dude go see how big the tree ha grown you 'll feel better then again probably not 

i had the vinyl two record set of bobby goldsboro 's 10th anniversary album and wa either trying to get that whole record on cd or at least all of the song on various cd which i wa finally able to do this ha most of those song and also some that were n't on it like hello loser whenever he hold you a song i like me japanese boy i love you it break my heart and if you wait for love the rest of the song were on that album they are the biggest song of his career see the funny little clown watching scotty grow and the monster honey which a big a it wa it probably would have been song of the year any other year but it seemed like it wa overshadowed by by the time i get to phoenix there are other very good song on here that probably are n't a well known the straight life which wa also done by glen campbell and john gary and one of my favorite bobby goldsboro song broomstick cowboy the cd end with summer and then after that kind of turn into a promotion for his latest album at the time this is a good cd by an artist who at his peak wa a hot a anybody but for whatever reason wa never taken too seriously 

this is an excellent compilation of bobby goldsboro 's hit and important track goldsboro is probably one of the more underrated singer from the 60 's his music wa at time sentimental but his delivery wa always heartfelt his first hit see the funny little clown wa self penned and still sound fresh his version of the burt bacharach me japanese boy i love you is a lovely ballad that sound fresh in this digital format little thing is a pop jewel that billy gilman covered several year ago with it popping chorus and original bass line it 's a track that hold up well 40 year later voodoo woman is another great rocking track with that pounding drumbeat voodoo woman you break every heart you see so voodoo woman stay away from me if you 've got a heart is a track that i 've come to enjoy a a result of this compilation with it pretty upbeat melody and breakup lyric the combination of opposite is kind of a musical version of tragicomedy broomstick cowboy is one of the more sentimental track that bobby wrote with it midtempo beat and a pretty melody my favorite goldsboro track is it 's too late with it pounding rhythm horn driving bass line and goldsboro 's expressive delivery i remember when i told you that i 'd try in every way to hold you kiss you love you keep you 'til my dying day you just laughed and said you found somebody new you did n't need all the thing i could do this is excellent classic rock blue autumn goldsboro 's biggest hit honey and autumn of my life all reflect the more sentimental side of his recording this collection is an excellent compilation of the magic of bobby goldsboro enjoy 

for the era in which i wa interested 1968 1973 this cd wa great because it had every bobby goldsboro song that ever charted then to my knowledge some really great sounding song especially for singer looking for acoustic guitar song to play solo are quot the straight life quot 1968 quot i'm a drifter quot 1969 and quot summer quot 1973 minor complaint 1 i'm pretty sure this recording of quot i'm a drifter quot fade out several second earlier than the original single version did 2 a very large percentage of these song are irritatingly trite and mawkish especially his earlier material even big hit like quot honey quot and later hit like quot watching scotty grow quot i never noticed that before but that 's why i gave 4 star instead of 5 

this is one of the more underrated unheard of album i 've come to know and love the eclectic mix of influence in matt mahaffey 's life are obvious a there are tone of hip hop tone of pop and tone of rock splashed within it and ha some of the best pop music that 's been released in a long time marathon shirt is one of my favorite track of all time and the single quot cannon quot and quot so low quot were large reason why i became addicted to the infectious music that mahaffey put out this is probably the most accessable self album that wa ever put out breakfast with girl is fairly accessable too and remains a one of the better album though quot the half baked serenade quot is absolutely great but good luck either finding it or finding it at an affordable price i paid 45 for mine about a year ago and it took me about 2 month for one to catch one go on sale on ebay gizmodgery another self project is also a good album but the fact that it 's a experimental a it is just make it a little le open to the average listener if you 've never heard of self buy this album it 's well worth it if you have heard of self you 've probably got it already and for those of you who have heard of self good luck finding quot half baked quot and quot gizmodgery quot i 've come to find that most people who buy this album end up fanatic like me 

if you are too young to remember the 1990s self 's subliminal plastic motif will give you an earful from the time nirvana releasednevermindin 1991 to the tragic end with britney spear baby one more time at the other end the clinton era wa home to some amazing rock based experiment subliminal plastic motif contains some of the chainsaw guitar that became so popular during the 1990s but this is no grunge album you 'll know this on hearing the second track sophomore jinx which combine guitar fuzz with a silky synth line trendier band were doing this but jinx turn a lot of melodic and textural curve and corner you are pulled in by having to listen twice most of this music ha a power pop sound but this is only a starting point self powder this music continuously with unexpected little detail doe the work that a lot of artist of the era were to grungy to do you 'll never mistake this for any other time but for the era this is a great example of how interesting mainstream rock could get 

i had this review completely written when my power went out a few hour ago and you know how frustrating it is to try to write something over by memory so i wo n't basically i wa disappointed by this album because i love self and wa expecting their debut to sound really fresh and exciting and creative but it 's frankly not a good a their quot breakthrough quot album if it can be called such breakfast with girl and of course nothing top their recorded using only toy instrument off the wall masterpiece gizmodgery which everyone in the world should own i recently sold my copy for 27 buck at half com it 's out of print and i'm counting on it being rereleased relatively soon anyway subliminal plastic motif sound like a fifth album tired uninspired and while self had definitely already established the root of their unique electropop sound it would n't achieve ultimate fruition until the 2nd or 3rd album 

this is self 's first outing and it is no le than excellent in any review of any disc by this marvelous act i will always say that matt mahaffey is a genius a little more guitar driven than future effort subliminal still ha raw unbridaled hook that make every song catchy intelligent and extreemly listenable after several play a cd that should already be on the shelf of any who know what good alternative music is all about 

self is one of the most innovative pop rock band of the 90 's and it 's a damn shame to see mike never broke out into the mainstream subliminal plastic motif while not his best album that go to gizmodgery which wa made only using toy instrument it 's probably the best for a new fan to get musically the album contains everything from power pop and jazz to hip hop influenced beat and nirvana guitar progression the way mike us each instrument is amazing i especially love how he us keyboard and piano plus vocally he 's killer very warm and inviting some of my favorite track off the album are the single so low borateen big important nothing which feature amazing jazzy keyboard and cannon 

again a collection of relatively short song passing through many rock sub genre elvis costello 's second lp is a good a it predecessor and it seems that his melodic sonse is even getting better the main difference between both effort is that the cut here sound much more like part of a unity actually like ` 'songs taken from costello 's 2nd album'' which they are an important leitmotiv here being a very clever use of synthesizer and keyboard sometimes sounding like a weird electronic hammond although his song are more traditionally melodic there is a weird sophisti trash aura in the air that allows his second masterpiece to be a funny a solid simultaneously difficult and easy plenty of hit and song deserving to be hit it 's a total classic among fan sngles include `'radio radio'' and `'pump it up'' and best cut include `'this year 's girl'' infectious `'the beat'' and shiny uptempo `'lipstick vogue'' with it crazy bass weird synth noise and fine drum treatment 

with 'this year 's girl ' elvis costello take the 3 minute pop song and make it into an art form nothing about the album is revolutionary on the surface but each song is dexterous and complex within it own simplistic framework the melody never feel calculated or mechanical despite how expertly they are crafted each note that costello sings seems like the natural progression from the previous note track 7 hand in hand is a particularly good example of costello 's fluidity a a songwriter there wa a time where i literally listened to this song on repeat over and over you belong to me and this year 's girl are sugary pop on the surface but over repeated listens they 're marked by an incredible attention to melodic detail the lyric are witty and thematically hit upon the notion of fleeting coolness costello seems jaded by how hipness corrupts he cynically sings about chelsea radio and paradise and the sad notion that love is a vapid and fleeting a the culture of model or celebrity costello 's raspy but superbly endearing voice convey this edginess and disenchantment without coming across a pretentious it 's interesting that this album still seems so hip because at least i interpret it it is an indictment of hipness the production is pitch perfect it wa released in 1978 but it could have been released yesterday that 's how fresh this album is the harmony are there but they 're not syrupy and the band the attraction brings an energy and musicianship that is uncharacteristic to an album that is so songwriting focused i do n't want to go to chelsea ha one of the best and most driving drumbeat in a pop song so doe no action the album 's fantastic opener the keyboard work throughout is also stellar though it may take a little while to get used to that cheesy organ sound this year 's model is definitely one of the best album the more endearing because of it outward simplicity and accessibility it is a work of craft sincerity and vision i love it 

in my quest to redisover the bespectaled one i found a used copy of reissue 1 of elvis' second album if you know anything about the latest record biz reissue craze it 's that they keep remastering and reissuing some classic album over and over again in slightly different form for elvis he is on his third round of reissue but i'm just buying used for now this year 's model found our boy a tad more angry than on his debut and with the help of newly recruited the attraction he found some keyboard and jumpy punk rock arguably the roughest and loudest of elvis' album featuring the cynism and adorable aggravation of elvis the album contains some of my favorite elvis song ever like pump it up little trigger i do n't want to go to chelsea and with this re release the single radio radio if you have n't started investigating early costello yet i may have to stop talking to you next on our elvis list is what will probably be my favorite elvis album armed force if for nothing other than i think oliver 's army is the ultimate elvis song 

this album is absolutely perfect every song is great in every way the songwriting musicianship and attitude are all just right and compliment each other perfectly elvis costello may be dignified and old now but anybody who 's heard this album know just how punk he wa back in the day just listen to the lyric on lipstick vogue or no action you do n't wanna mess with this guy also he 's the only person who ha ever looked good in those glass 

fun song on this sophomore effort 'pump it up' 'lipstick vogue' 'radio radio' ec rock harder here than on his debut recording this solidly round out my top 5 standard costello recording 

what you have here is elvis at the top of his game both in song writing and musically making this release a classic and essential recording following on the heals of a smashing debut this release prof that elvis wa no passing fad but rather a powerhouse that would help shape the face of contemporary music 

though it wa his second studio album it contains so many classic that it could be called a greatest hit album quot radio radio quot quot this year 's girl quot quot the beat quot and quot i do n't want to go to chelsea quot were some of the top song of the new wave they sound just a full of spit and vitriol today a they did almost a quarter century ago it wa amazing to hear elvis finally do quot radio radio quot on snl backed up by the beastie boy if you 're wondering when elvis wa actually quot cruel quot listen to this masterpiece 

in truth i 've only been exposed to ten or eleven of elvis' 30 record some are very good some are very bad still others are just okay but this year 's model beat 'em all except possibly it sequel armed force the first thing you may notice about this album is the difference in band clover costello 's collaborator on my aim is true his third best were just another bar band not the attraction the attraction were an anaglam of punk new wave and a bit of funk listen to bruce thomas' bass and you 'll know what i'm talking about they 're also far more fierce they do n't just rock they rock with a vengeance and everybody add something important bruce and pete thomas give a strong supple funk rock rhythm section steve nieve weird sometimes cheesy keyboard and elvis of course give the venom then there 's the songwriting which is even sharper than it wa first time out the melody are always strong whether the song itself is great the beatles like no action the cynical this year 's girl lightspeed lipstick vogue or just okay little trigger hand in hand but even the just okay song are listenable and the lyric remember how i talked about venom it 's all over the place you 've got your big bad funky anti hendoist classic pump it up with the ultimate shout along chorus arena ready but in a good way and that bass solo the nervy paranoid very underrated beat which i think is my favorite on the album i love the chorus and neive 's keyboard the unforgivably nasty take no prisoner attitude of this year 's girl based on the rolling stones' stupid girl which it manages to one up in the anger department the aforementioned lipstick vogue which again spare nothing in putting down an ex lover sometimes i almost feel just like a human being great great lyric and my second favorite i do n't want to go to chelsea where costello unloads all his ire against vanity and it 's funky with elvis almost rapping over the tight groove love it oh almost forgot the spector esque protest radio radio what a song while costello wa mad with everybody he decided corrupt payola influenced dj 's would be another valid target and while it 's essentially whining who can argue with the brutal lyric they say you 'd better listen to the voice of reason but they do n't give you a choice because they think that it 's treason or something like that love the video too i'm not the kind who sits around watching mtv or vh1 i saw it at a hard rock cafe but it wa amazing just so unpretentiously fun look at steve nieve in the background totally making a fool of himself it 's worth noting that right afterwards gn'r 's pompous unintentionally hilarious video for estranged came on no need to ask which one i prefered i hope more to the point though that 's a hell of a video and this is a hell of an album like my aim is true and armed force it 's all the costello a beginner need along with a compilation of some kind 

i had been in a deer hunting accident i awoke in a hospital and down the hall a boombox wa playing this album very loudly i knew everything wa going to be okay 

it 's easy to see why this is usually listed a among the best album of the 70 's coming off a very decent debut album few could have been ready for this brilliant follow up which reminds me a lot of tom petty 's best work with the heartbreaker the musicianship and songwriting ha improved greatly over the debut effort due no doubt to the more polished backing band that represents the attraction a well a costello himself imcreasing in confidence and maturing in ability the sound quality of this remastered version is also brilliant and together with the wonderful mini lp sleeve design which includes all the lyric in english and japanese a an insert make this the best version of this album that is out there at the moment highly recommended 

if only for the great bonus live disc i am sure they could have just released the concert on it own and sold it out many time over like another reviewer suggested this is even more thrilling than the el mocambo concert disc but they could 've fixed that also by releasing the entire mocambo show un edited setlists being similar we probably do n't need both but heck elvis could release them anyway a whole passel of live show release would be nice for that matter docked one star only because the bonus material on the first disc ha already been reissued 

ca n't disagree with anyone here except to question the notion of ec coming even slightly below presley and the beatles in the ol' pantheon of rock god in my opinion he crush both of 'em rrrgh my favourite costello album still ha to be armed force but this is almost a breathtaking particularly after the maddeningly inconsistent my aim is true to be fair there is n't a whole lot of difference between the song musically loud'n'ferocious is pretty much the consistent thread throughout but that matter not a whit while the thing is playing very loudly one would hope is it possible that the second quot capital punishment she 's last year 's model quot in chelsea is the single most ferociously delivered couplet in rock 's history yes i rather think it is but that 's just the tip of the non proverbial iceburg a everything here rock full tilt some of the bonus track naturally are n't awe inspiring but rr is good a is the mick jones featuring big tear and the demo of greenshirt while not necessarily better than the quot finished quot version on armed force is quite an interesting take on the song very minimalistic much le orchestration who care i like 'em both 'cause elvis is god and if you do n't own this album you will be forever damned to wander a nightmarish musical wasteland and i mean every word of that 

if you are in a party mood this is definitely a record to play the variation between track is not that great but that is not the most critical issue hear because most of the song are really good the extra track add soemthing sepcial especially the last three acoustic one a i never pictured elvis a an acoustic artist he doe quite well in that realm however pump it up lip service and no action are my three faves on this one elvis really put alot of effort into this one and that will make it a good deal for most record collection 

the concert on disc 2 and the 8 bonus track on disc 1 are quite the deal could 've been a whole album set by themselves the concert stuff on disc 2 smoke what an energy what you 'd expect from a rowdy rock n roll crowd from the late 70 and it 's cool to hear a younger elvis interacting with them and hearing them fuel his performance a well he really put a fire into the performance and all the instrument and everything just ha the best of live energy having gotten into costello 's later stuff first when i wa cruel era this year 's model never completely hooked me but this set is the way to go if you want to explore cause it give you the studio album first put you through some demo and obscure cut after that some of which are a good or better than the cut on the original album and then when you 're wondering how well you enjoyed the album you throw on disc 2 and you get the whole thing again live into the bargain and it 's a hand down top notch show that ought to renew your whole respect for the album and the heady year of 1978 

costello 's first album my aim is true wa perfect his second album this year's model is even better on this album all of the sexual tension that had been built up on his debut get released just take a look at the song title this album is very much about sex fortunately costello is literate enough that he doe n't have to stoop to using graphic language instead he us all sort of similies and metaphor this album just explodes with energy also this album serf a a wonderful transition from his first album my aim is true to his third album armed force 

many people seem to regard this year 's model a the best costello album out there i agree with most of this opinion but naming it his best neglect his other important work elvis costello 's first 6 album excluding almost blue work a an all for one one for all outfit but even so i 'd personally place this year 's model a the initial masterpiece that set the wheel of costello 's career in motion after his first record costello came up with a set of song that were even faster more aggressive and cerebral this year 's model could be represented a elvis' epitome of anger and his most new wave album out there this is also the first album which give full credit to elvis costello and the attraction the most explosive combo to come out of the pub rock scene if there is something that this album lack is a passive mood every song is bold outspoken brutallity in the most fashionable way the first four song show off these characteristic weather it 's the smashing feeling of pump it up or the flow of rythm in this year 's girl initially i felt that the album started to mellow at the beginning of the second half maybe because of the great punch the first half of the record give off but if you get to listen to it a couple of time completely all of the song get stuck in your memory lip service and lipstick vogue are great example of this the instrumentation of this year 's model is flawless loud but precise guitar mood setting drum and the best use of moog organ synthesizer i 've ever heard in a rock album the lyric also come at their finests the rhyme are mesmerazing and accurate there is not one element of this album that i do not enjoy except maybe the song little trigger which i usually skip a any other good album it invite you to listen to it over and over again it ha the perfect timing for it to be memorable but not tedious it also leaf you hungry for more elvis costello material which a i stated on the beginning of this review you are going to require 

though costello 's debut gave the first peak at his lyrical and singing voice it wa quot this year 's model quot that really found the punchy electric presentation that brought it home the key difference is the attraction quot this year model quot pack a much punch a anything that came out in the so called new wave costello 's biting lyric and stinging vocal and guitar are perfectly matched by the attraction from the very opening of the first track quot no action quot costello 's quiet intro line is kicked into drive from the very first beat of pete thomas' drum and stepped into overdrive when steve nieve 's and bruce thomas add their keyboard and bass it wa a though costello 's song had just been waiting for this treatment nick lowe exacts the punchiest possible sound out of the band a they string together gem after gem costello and crew may have extended or refined the sound on subsequent album but the sheer brashness of their invention shine through every track of quot this year model quot in a way they would never be improved by repetition quot this year model quot which ha the original british running order feature 6 bonus track including the single quot radio radio quot and quot big tear quot the soundtrack cut quot crawling to the usa quot early version of armed force 's quot greenshirt quot and quot big boy quot well worth the upgrade for those who have the original vinyl or non bonus track version of the cd 

pop rock at it late 70 's height show a thinking man 's bruce springsteen continuing to harness amazing energy and tight interplay out of proportion to many of his peer furthering an already torrential amount of praise only after this sophomore release undeniably rock solid but only a handful of entry sound entirely brilliant 

elvis costello this year model ryko single cd 6 bonus track this great album is made even greater on this ryko single cd release early costello is great fun and great writing call it `new wave' or `punk' or `larry' it is just good music this one get five star ryko get six star 

costello 's second album continues in the same vein a his debut angry tale of love lust and sheer pent up frustration dominated by steve nieve 's organ this cd is more polished than costello 's debut but it feel a little over produced compared to the stripped down sound of his first release despite this the song still create a sense of tension rarely found in anyone 's music quot radio radio quot may be one of the greatest song ever about the idea of quot popular music quot and it effect on u all and the double play of quot the beat quot and quot pump it up quot sum up teen year pretty well costello is a truly original talent and this cd show him during the early year still coming to grip with many of the same idea and fear that faced his liteners this review is of the original american recording 

declan patrick mcmanus a he wa known to his parent is a genius this album released in 1978 wa his second album and his first with his backing band the attraction what a mighty fine album it wa back then and what a mighty fine album it is today being a huge elvis fan i 'll confess i 've even bought a pair of prescription glass which are elvis esque choosing my favourite elvis album is like trying to choose a favourite child i know this is a typical album review cliche but it 's a serious dilemma simply for the fact that he ha released so many brilliant album imperial bedroom trust king of america all superb album in their own right i see this year 's model a elvis' real debut album his debut quot my aim is true quot had it fair share of superb moment red shoe alison i'm not angry but i always felt it wa a practice for what he achieved here even though this is elvis' heaviest and most punk influenced album his music doe n't fit into the category of traditional punk for a start elvis can sing his lyric are highly original and out of this world he ha a vision he know what he want to say and he say it did i mention how good it all sound quot the beat quot is one of elvis' most infectious pop punk offering quot living in paradise quot start with one of his best guitar riff and only go up from there quot lip service quot is foot tapping heaven quot this year 's girl quot ha one of elvis' best sentiment in a perfect 3 minute pop song and i have n't even mentioned the brilliantly executed single quot pump it up quot quot i do n't want to go to chelsea quot and the superb stand alone single quot radio radio quot which ha been added a a bonus track on the re issue of this cd who need elvis impersonator the real elvis is alive on this album and he ha never sounded better 

the first three album by elvis costello are not only his three best album ever they are three of the finest album released by any artist of that era while my aim is true stand a one of the greatest debut album ever i feel that his next two release armed force and this year 's model were even better than his first excellent work this year 's model is the peak of elvis costello 's angry and cynical lyrical database with fast raucous music that ups the intensity like only elvis could when i think of the numerous punk group of that era that i enjoyed like black flag sex pistol and the dead kennedy i take the odd step of lumping this year 's model in with the same sarcastic emotion backing the music while the abovementioned punk group may have marketed themselves to the kid who fancied themselves raw gritty and streetwise elvis seemed geared toward the everyday middle class joe who despite no torn jean or mohawk still possessed that bitterness toward commercialism and the rat race this album ha classic costello rant that range from relationship gone sour to the greedy corporate world with some song like living in paradise seemingly combining both the tune grow increasingly intense with each track with hand in hand and lipstick vogue grabbing most of the glory in the second half of the album no resting no misleading guajardian twist just sharp music and seething lyric radio radio is the appropriate finale of this year 's model which is a loud fast break free tune that totally bash the formula based model of commercial radio i remember when this song wa released and how much i loved it every time i heard it played on one of the same commercial radio station he wa thumbing his nose at it wa like hearing an employee cursing out his bos and receiving a promotion for it elvis costello ha since released quite a diverse array of music since this year 's model some of it i love some i do n't get but there is nothing quite like his first three album if you want to buy a best of elvis costello compilation then stay away from his best of compilation buy his first three release instead because they truly are the very best of elvis costello 

listening to this year model after 22 year gasp one is struck by how current and urgent it all still sound the lyric are so sharp and the song are so well structured that i am reminded of cole porter i do n't think elvis costello ever topped this even though he came close so many time insight anger and humor are combined into his unique style that cut through all the hypocrisy in the world like acid poured on metal 

my aim is true wa a promising debut but this year 's model elvis costello 's sophomore effort and first album with long time backing band the attraction is an all out stunner everything on this puppy from the song to the performance to the cover art just look at that sneer drip with the aggression menace and black humor that have become ec trademark for one thing the attraction rule the band pack a sonic punch that clover the group that backed elvis on my aim is true simply could n't muster they 've got a raucous full bodied sound that bridge the gap between punk new wave rock `n' roll and even 60 garage rock steve nieve 's freewheeling keyboard playing is the ideal partner for the compact snarl of costello 's guitar chord while bruce thomas' nimble bass line duck weave and squirm beneath them pete thomas' drumming lends the appropriate sense of straight ahead urgency to the whole thing while giving the proceeding a sufficiently rockin' backbone thanks to the attraction these song have a certain bite that wa buried on my aim is true of course it doe n't hurt that costello 's songwriting is absolutely stellar he may look like a harmless fellow on his album cover but his lyric are anything but the guy writes with a poison pen flinging venom dipped dart in every possible direction without ever missing his mark his unapologetic cynicism is matched by his dark sense of humor and deliciously twisted worldview all of it come together on no action the album 's breathless opener at just over two minute in length it 's a juggernaut of warped fifty melody and pummeling guitar costello 's vocal is both cheeky and bitter a he spews forth a series of withering putdowns at some special someone who probably deserves every word of it hand in hand and lip service are equally spiteful tale of derailed romance and living in paradise ups the ante with it depiction of wanton betrayal and relentless paranoia and it ha a cheerful bubbling melody this year 's girl match a leering halting musical assault with lyric that take a sharp stab at celebrity culture and lipstick vogue is pure amphetamine sleaze little trigger is a broken doo wop ballad essaying a crumbling relationship with enough bitter disillusionment to last a lifetime you belong to me is a gleefully sardonic look at male aggression and pump it up is a rollicking party song with lyric about the worthlessness of party night rally is a dark atmospheric track that see costello flirting with image of fascism and revolution the beat possibly my favorite track here is tale of sexual frustration that brim with raw aggression and nervous energy i'm also in love with the stunning i do n't want to go to chelsea which us a taut crawling ska influenced groove to slowly build tension while costello 's lyric are pure claustrophobic sexual paranoia so a masterpiece then get it 

elvis costello is my favorite singer and this is a classic album i love it so much here 's my favorite song no action radio radio the beat crawling to the usa i do n't want to go to chelsea this year girl and big tear 

after scoring success with his debut album my aim is true elvis costello wasted no time in recording a follow up this year 's model take everything that made his first album great and multiplies it several time over the catchy melody and intricate wordplay remain firmly intact but they 're given an extra dose of energy by ec 's famous backing band the attraction composed of bruce thomas on bass pete thomas on drum and steve nieve on keyboard it 's a firecracker combination that doe n't let up for even a second during the album 's 39 minute duration no action open the record with such intensity that it 's almost exhausting just to listen to elvis begin by snarling i do n't wanna kiss you i do n't wanna touch i do n't wanna see you 'cause i do n't miss you that much every member of the band come in at full throttle and it 's a perfect slice of punk energy that demand your attention and leaf you feeling like you just stepped off a roller coaster when it end just two minute later i ca n't think of a better way to introduce the attraction and it let you know immediately that this album will be louder rougher and more intense than the first the record contains a couple well known hit most notably pump it up which everyone ha heard at some point even by today 's standard it still sound fresh and energetic making it a well deserved classic in costello 's vast catalogue radio radio wa a controversial diatribe against corporate radio and it predictable play it safe attitude toward music while i do n't wanna go to chelsea ride a killer guitar riff that firmly ingrains it in your mind after just one listen the beat and little trigger are both prime slice of pop while hand in hand and lip service are trademark costello song whose dark lyric are cleverly disguised by an upbeat melody living in paradise is one of my favorite and find elvis in a state of jealousy and frustration before concluding you better have your fun before it move along and already you 're looking for another fool like me perhaps the attractions' finest hour come in the form of lipstick vogue pete thomas' drum open with a furious solo and intensity that only heightens a steve 's organ chime in a the song blaze by with a punk ferocity that 's impossible to ignore every track here is impressive and there 's not a trace of filler or wasted space it would have been hard for any artist to follow my aim is true and costello took a big risk by going with a louder and more forceful sound however it work perfectly and there 's no denying that the attraction are a major key to this success they take costello 's song and elevate them to incredible height each musician is amazingly skilled and they all get equal chance to shine here if costello 's first album proved him to be a naturally gifted songwriter then this year 's model proved that he wa here to stay and wa n't afraid to take his sound in new direction his first album wa stellar and this one in my humble opinion is even better do n't miss it 

i'm so sick of packing for college i go back on saturday i really need a break ahh nothing like cdnow review to kill time anyway i'm living proof that this album is an alltime great enjoyed by people of all age i love it my friend love it my friend parent love it every song is hummable and instantly burrow it way deep into your head where it wont come out for week on top of that this is a lyrical masterpiece only topped by my aim is true who else would use the term rhythmically admired it may not be a diverse a the later album but it our last chance to hear good old school hard rocking elvis this should be considered required listening for any rock mucic fan do yourself a favor and buy this and if you already have it buy it for someone who doesnt 

elvis costello this year model the toss up between the bug two by the big two i mean elvis costello 's two biggest album his debut my aim is true and his sophomore effort this year model and which is better many will tell you his le famous album which he realesed after this year model were his best but really i have never understood why with costello everyone insists on comparing all his album and constantly ranking them honestly the man ha never mad a bad record his band the atractions is one of the best punk new wave post punk band of all time his song writing is simply put prolific a a guitar player he is fantastic a well and a for this year model the album is incredible it wa his second album realesed in 1978 this brit managed to realease two of the greatest album in rock history with his first two at bat song like 'lipstick vougue' evoke image of the replacement the romantic clash and john lennon sexy comlicated angry and somehow meloncolly all at the same time 'pump it up' is the deffinition of new wave 'hand in hand' is touching while the reggea influenced ' i dont want to go to chelsea' is both loose and fun and at time disturbing known for his brilliant imagry in his lyric song like 'this year girl' 'little triggers' and 'night rally' dont dissapoint the album big hit single well maybe not big but still hit single 'radio radio' is a classic and propelled this album and the atractions to major success and right afterward costello threw it all away to be true to himself which i will always take my hat of to him for that a long a i live the bonus disk which come with this particular issue is a must have for those who are die hard costello fan but not one i would recomend to the average fan so is this year model better then my aim is true or any of costellos other album doe it really matter well no it doe n't but to answer the question i must give my opinion and say that this is his most focused album and also his most asseble and varied but in my opinion this is only his second best album my aim is true is far superior even though this year model is a fantastic album 

this year 's model is definitive elvis costello it 's the hardest rocking of all of his album and each song is a triumph of the now venerable songwriter this album feature all the classic the stream of consciousness `pump it up' the brilliant `i do n't want to go to chelsea' the chilling `night rally' and `radio radio' this album exemplifies how good elvis can be it is the best thing he 's ever made and lay the foundation for a lot of the contemporary punk pop music around today perhaps the best feature of this year 's model is that it 's a rock album with brilliant lyric costello is known for his lyricism and this year 's model in my opinion show costello at his lyrical best each song is like a poem in that the lyric are complex deep and meaningful this album is an integral part of any costello fan 's collection and is also perfect for anyone wanting to get a feel for what his music is like a must buy 

elvis costello is never easy to pin down he 's a punk a crooner a folkie and a jazzman all at once one thing is certain he is a brlliant artist and a great songwriter with a healthy pop sense before costello branched out into other style his main focus on the punky side of pop and this is his most defining moment in that era each song on here crackle with the tight energy associated with punk but there is too much tongue and cheek for this be hardcore moreover the songwriting is just too clever to ignore further removing this year 's model from the general english punk movement elvis wa always too civilized to be chaotic and angry more of a crossed up lover than anything else this year 's model is just a brilliant album overall and should be in anyone 's collection 

elvis 's first disk with the attraction steve nieve bruce and pete thomas burn brightly even today the songwriting is wonderfully acerbic the band sound is stripped down to a live feel and each musician kill a must own 

elvis costello 's second album this year 's model ha received the re release treatment before most recently in 2001 but this truly must be regarded a the ultimate 30th anniversary deluxe reissue treatment cd1 23 track 70 min first brings the original album and what a delight it remains 30 year later it almost sound like a greatest hit album in and of it own with classic like pump it up i do n't wanna go to chelsea and radio radio but the non single track just sound a good in retrospect such a no action you belong to me etc there are 10 bonus track including delightful b side like big tear crawling to the usa and tiny step several other track are repeat from the 2001 re release including the delightful alternate version of chelsea cd2 17 track 63 min brings the complete show of the band at washington 's warner theatre and what an absolute delight that is this wa recorded in february 1978 a couple of month before this year 's model wa released and the set mix then old from my aim is true and then unheard from the upcoming album track and it is just fabulous costello and his band are at their absolute best throughout the highlight for me is the expanded 6 min version of watching the detective but there is n't a single weak moment on here and any serious music fan will want to have this both for the quality of the concert and for it historical value not to be missed 

i happened upon a leftover copy of the rykodisc re issue of this year 's model after it had gone out of print one day at border happy i had found this hard to find gem this wa a while before the new 2 cd re issue i purchased the album and popped it in my car stereo costello open the disc proclaiming quot i do n't wanna kiss you i do n't wanna touch quot before the attraction explode into a fit of pop punk rage i wa blown away the production wa crisp rich and full of unbridled chaotic energy even when costello slows it down on this album quot little trigger quot the result is no le energetic or passionate other such classic include quot pump it up quot quot i do n't wanna go to chelsea quot and quot this year 's girl the attraction are a much stronger band than clover who accompained costello on my aim is true thus making this year 's model the stronger album although my aim is true is still classic the bonus track are also nice including the indispensible quot radio radio quot a biting vicious attack on radio this is essential listening please purchase 

this second album by elvis costello is far better than my aim is true in my opinion the tune are more immediate with much more of a pop flavour whilst the music is also more rhythmically varied and compelling it mark the transition to his wonderfully accessible armed force masterpiece there is even a reggae beat in i do n't want to go to chelsea and a ballad with lovely piano little trigger my favourite on the original disc are the up tempo pump it up you belong to me and the poignant this year 's girl plus of course the pulsating radio radio with it subversive lyric night rally is somewhat dark and disturbing the second disc includes a wealth of previously unreleased track demo track live and alternative version not all of these alternate take are a gripping a the familiar version but they are certainly interesting and worthwhile demonstrating various facet of his extraordinary musicianship 

this year 's model wa elvis costello 's second album and his first with the attraction mr costello embodied the angry attitude of punk rock but unlike most punk band who were unskilled musician that thrived on high energy he possessed a rapier pen and an ear for melody the album open with the fierce no action that in fine punk form clock in at le than two minute this year 's girl is wry take on the fame machine the beat ha a catchy organ riff and is about the tried and true subject of self gratification pump it up is a fiery track a is lip service i do n't want to go to chelsea ha a manic verve while little trigger slows thing down radio radio is the most famous off the album but the album 's best track is lipstick vogue the song ha a thumping bass line that shuffle along until a frenzied close this year 's model gave further proof that elvis costello may well be the king 

i note there is some debate here about where the two most famous elvis rank in the rock pantheon one thing 's for sure only one of them wa a songwriter elvis costello 's 1977 debut album heralded the emergence of a major new talent and helped save music from languishing in a sea of mediocrity with some honourable exception neil young come to mind most of the readily accessible music i e radio around in the mid 70 wa shocking almost a bad a the clothes i now realise that is the reason why we schoolkids all had to go back in time to find something we actually liked disco wa anathema to the boy anyway the sex pistol were a revelation but to we aspiring musician they could n't play to save their life the pistol were historically important and fun but a far a genuine talent go just do n't stack up and a i heard someone admit recently they scared u callow suburban kid to death when i heard 'chelsea' i felt that here at last wa something worth listening to and so it turned out this the follow up to costello 's impressive debut cemented his reputation a a first rate singer songwriter if that 's the right term and left his contemporary the jam and perhaps the clash apart looking very sick like paul weller costello managed to fuse a punkish attitude with a pop sensibility delivering a satisfying cocktail of great melody and a hard edge curiously in later year they both shelved that edge temporarily so a to indulge their passion for american style crooning a with the debut this year 's model is chock full of powerful three minute gem with great lyric quot sometimes i think that love is just a tumour you 've got to cut it out quot that stick in your head the attraction provide frenetic and fantastic backing particularly on 'lipstick vogue' for costello 's clever insightful and uncannily infectious song and producer nick lowe transfer all the excitement to disc with aplomb british pop or new wave or punk or whatever you want to call it at it very best 

i put that a the review title so people would n't get confused there are a million special edition version of this cd but mine is just the basic which is suprisingly okay given that this is a whole lot of excellent music i only knew like half the song on here but the song are all pretty good and balanced i also partly picked this up because a lovely female friend of mine think mr costello is the best musician ever if you 've never heard mr costello he sort of seems comical the best way to describe what he sound like is tom petty mixed with devo actually i'm not saying anything bad about him if you are getting into his style of music then get my aim is true or 13 step lead down along with this disc those are good for if you know his music but have n't really listened to entire cd yet well this cd itself is all great song the sound quality is also fantastic considering the age of the recording and the fact it 's not remastered 

costello 's second album this year 's model took the potential shown in 1977 's classic my aim is true and ran with it elvis costello 's punk sensibility melodic yet tight guitar and sharp political commentary wa now paired to a great backing band the attraction steve nieve on keyboard bruce thomas on bass and pete thomas on drum far from a sophomore slump this year 's model might be costello 's best release and ha probably aged better than anything else he 's done in punk fashion costello 's song are short and forceful hovering right around 2 3 minute however do n't expect clash or sex pistol like aggression and buzzing guitar costello 's early work is about a rock 'n' roll a one can get melodic tuneful and irresistable costello 's acerbic and humourous lyric comment on a great many thing the fashion industry on this year 's girl orwellian paranoia on living in paradise and a pan of commercial radio on radio radio made famous by elvis costello 's controversial guest spot on saturday night live if you can enjoy costello 's quirky vocal i happen to really like them than this year 's model will definitely have appeal punkers looking for something different will probably really like this album his other early album my aim is true armed force are in a similar vein and also worth purchasing note for the most part the rhino reissue is really nice with great liner note penned by elvis himself and one of the best remasters i 've heard in recent year however wa the bonus disk really necessary big tear and stranger in the house could have been included on the first disk a bonus track while the rest of the bonus material is made up of middling demo and live stuff that is only of interest to completists all the bonus disk doe is jack up the price of the album not a big deal but more thought should 've been put into this 

costello 's second album and his first with the attraction is his most 34 punk 34 not in any i hate cop sense but in his emotionally explosive writing and his backing band vicious gallop 

if you love music you must obtain this cd period every cut is fantastic standouts include pump it up with it throbing punkish trait lip stick vogue with it defiently witty lyric sometimes i almost feel like a human living in paradise with it full bodied sound radio radio you better shup up or get cut out a live version of neat neat neat i could list every trac the cd is that good it wa a important album when it came out giving early clue to who the true king of rock and roll is a man named elvis after all warning dont buy this album unless you want to be blown away with an album from 1978 that is a fresh today a it way when it wa the day it wa pressed into an lp an essential album not only of costello but of rock 

edgier than both quot my aim is true quot and quot armed force quot this is perhaps the greatest album of the punk new wave era of the late '70s with the addition of the extra track this album ha become in '70s terminology an excellent quot double album quot without a loser in the bunch elvis' best classic 

the merit of this album need not be discussed here this year 's model ha been widely regarded a a rock classic for over twenty year now what doe need addressing however is the sound rhino ha acheived in rendering this recording on cd the 'remastering' game that ha been going on for the past decade ha yielded mixed result record company promising superior sound have come up short more than half the time when it come to reissuing classic lucky for u that 's hardly the case with rhino 's treatment of elvis costello 's back catalog this year 's model is what every fan hope for when plunking down hard earned cash for an album he already owns the sound is incredibly warm with every instrument coming through distinctly it is a if the attraction have set up shop in your living room seriously the immediacy of this recording is so impressive that i had to play it on the cheapest stereo in my house just to make sure i wa n't imagining it revisit a classic and hear what you missed the first time around this rhino series will be the death of our pocketbook 

if my aim is true with bonus disc landed on the music scene like a stick of dynamite with the fuse lit this year 's model wa the explosion that came after elvis' first album with the attraction more than lived up to it predecessor in that having a working band behind him matched the music to the blunt force of the song once again it is the stark voice of ec that opened the album a he ominously intones i do n't wannna kiss you i do n't wanna touch when the player kick in it 's a whole 'nother world from my aim is true and for the first time new wave had a front man before this album had been released one of the central song had made headline elvis' broadside at narrow format broadcasting radio radio wa performed in such a bizarre fashion on saturday night live that he wa effectively banned from the show for almost a decade and made this then seventeen year old a fan for life that performance sealed a decision for me to get into radio and make artist like elvis accessible to listener when i wa fortunate enough to tell him this many year later elvis kindly autographed a ragged poster of armed force do n't blame me personal nostalgia aside fourth cd version this year 's model contains all the song that comprised the original u and uk version and the original uk artwork these are some of the song by which ec is measured like radio radio pump it up and the beat the attractions' playing wa melody driven in addition to frenetic a perfect compliment to elvis' brilliant lyric and it wa already becoming apparent that keyboardist steve nieve wa becoming an architect of what american ear would identify a punk rock the remainder of this year 's model provides some hot song that proved what this band of raving 20 somethings were capable in their rock and roll youth this wa the second of elvis' angry young man trilogy and it is a perfect moment 

rhino record and elvis costello deserve high praise for this re release this two cd set contains the original album on the first disc and a second disc of outtake live version and an odd couple of song all of fairly high quality accompanying the two cd is an essay by elvis costello commenting on the song and the history behind their inclusion or exclusion in the case of the second cd this year model feature a young elvis costello fresh from his saturday night live radio radio era the cd is full of quirk energy clever lyric and youthful anger from first song to last there is n't a bad tune the additional cd contains the lost big tear which costello explains should have been included in the original album also in the second cd are live version and a cover of the damned neat neat neat this album and the half dozen or more to follow were among the most influential music being made by the punk new wave great stuff 

i love this album but i will defend the right of anyone to hate it on paper this whole concept should n't work the beat is slow enough to appear hesitant the guitar are strumming one chord off a velvet underground album but by god they captured a mood perfectly quot listen the snow is falling quot say it all galaxie 500 's quot on fire quot ha better song but this album is their most individualistic statement perfect summer listening 

i 'll grant that the sound quality is pretty bad and it 's not their best album that would be quot on fire quot but beating up this album seems kind of distasteful to me sort of like beating up a beautiful defenseless animal 

at it and so begin 4th of july probably one of my favorite galaxie 500 line ever next to i stayed home on the 4th of july and i pulled the shade so i did n't have to see the sky and i decided to have a bed in but i forgot to invite anybody only dean wareham 's fractured genius can paint a picture of isolation and self doubt in this way and his detached storytelling verse remind me of the gift in a sillier setting sorry ha this cool dreamy haze going on a doe melt away and king of spain pt 2 with it delicate percussion and wave of guitar gently drift along find your own classic own this lp i ca n't speak for the reissue because i have the rough trade orig 

i must admit that it took me many listens to this is our music before it truly sunk in a a piece of slow moving dream pop genius galaxie 500 create a lush epic where guitar both acoustic and electric swirl together in a gorgeous haze the record open with the incredible quot fourth of july quot which for a long time ruined the album for me this song is perhaps galaxie 500 's strongest and to me everything that followed just could not hold a candle to it but after a while and after getting heavily into the work of my bloody valentine slowdive the velvet underground and low the other song on the record began to show themselves a unique brilliant entity quot hearing voice quot and quot spook quot are surreal pop tune while the superb quot summertime quot and a cover of yoko ono 's quot listen the snow is falling quot are lavish guitar epic that give dean wareham a chance to let loose while all the sound build to a monumental crescendo if you decide to explore this record by galaxie 500 do not let initial disappointment scare you away like all great record this is our music take time to infiltrate one 's consciousness a a piece of extraordinary artistry 

though this is our music wa the last album by galaxie 500 the end of the band had been unfolding for quite some time with several of these song sounding much like apologizes from dean to his young mate damon and naomi i'm not sure that he knew what he wa apologizing for i think that he just knew that thing were n't right and did n't know what to do about it other then to leave the band to save himself while the album still maintains that luscious mix of extended wash and reverb both the sound and the lyric are distantly moving in the direction of what luna would soon be presenting all of the song are the stuff of legend from their haunting cover of listen the snow is falling to the mysterious melt away the utterly brilliant sorry and king of spain a surrealistic acid drenched vision of what could be if only seldom is a band able capture such raw honesty and remain in tact this is our music is like that break up talk where finger are pointed where the old always the never happened and i'm giving back all that you gave me take place only galaxie 500 manage to do it with style sliding thing in through the backdoor and filling the room with atmospheric trigers to draw out the emotion we all seek to hide away from everyone especially ourselves this is our music is one of those album that get better with each listen the reason being that they 've taken all they 've learned giving up a brand new vision applying all their heart and soul in one last endeavor not to prove anything to the world but to each other for those of you who are a taken with galaxie 500 a i and have a compelling need to be a collection completist rough trade included the bonus 45 rpm single tugboat a a one sided record in randomly selected early vinyl package there is a round sticker on the front of these album which read i n d i e p o o l includes limited bonus single really it 's actually a one sided single 45 rpm the reverse side is blank now how cool is that treasure review by jenell kesler 

i go waaaaay back with bruce back when his album were all hard to find import i stopped buying him after the disappointment of big circumstance and nothing but and dart to the heart seems like he wa still writing great music but i wa n't connecting with it so i'm catching up and re listening to everything after world of wonder and realize i'm not missing much a always his lyric are exceptional but this is a dreary monotone album where he 34 speak sings 34 pretty much throughout 34 pacing the cage 34 is the 34 old bruce 34 and a great great song the rest lack hook melody or refrain best to sit back and slip on the headphone and listen to his story you wo n't sing along but at least you 're listening to an artist not at all at the top of his game though 

you can feel the passion in bruce 's music a he talk and sings about a world that is n't always that pretty he is not afraid to be himself and let his own style flow quot pacing the cage quot is particularly soulful bruce will probably be writing and producing music into his 70 's ca n't wait for more cd 's jm 

bruce cockburn ha been the don mclean of canada for four decade and this is his best album i highly recommend it to anyone who love rock and roll lady di loved him 

the world of charity of night seems one of fear and blindness of mob hit charity of night and prison whether of the heart pacing the cage or of metal night train birmingham shadow of police state and dissident but the lyric and the music itself point to a hope beyond the darkness although certainly one of cockburn 's intention is brecht like to create enough angst in u to not forget that there is a world rife with well what shall we call it terror sin bad guy beyond our speaker bruce is a superb musician and his voice is haunting a jewel among the cockburn collection 

bruce is from ottawa although a major part of the early day and his management company are focused on toronto celtic islamic what cockburn 's guitar sryle is blue jazz based with a strong root element to it but i 've never thought of him a celtic and certainly where islamic came from allah only know can he please be called quintessentially canadian which should mystify the great labelizers of the music world enough to give cockburn the room he need to create extraordinary music those quibble aside this is rightly one of bc 's absolute gem particularly this far into his career there is a wild range of emotion running through these song and bruce 's fretwork i still ca n't believe celtic islamic is dazzling allah and ossian be praised the chugging train rhythm of the opening track set an authentic root tone to a deeply personal statement and back up vocal from jonatha brooke and ani de franco give this cd an urgency pacing the cage written in the dismal environs of philadelphia is a dire an assessment of fate a i have ever heard it absolutely break your heart coming rain rejoycefully rebound the spirit and birmingham shadow is one of those brilliant cockburn epic part poem part lyric that hint at a love perhaps illicit at least dangerous yet determined to flourish and become consummated regardless of the potential for oppression mine of mozambique return cockburn to the political arena throughout these 9 song cockburn present intoxicating landscape and passionate human drama he is far and away one of the very greatest of north american writer and a crafter of melody that live with the listener a very very long time cockburn is his own man certainly an exitentialist and christian kind of hero and a he address his topic he very willingly break the bond that any label might impose upon him you would be better served taking the man on his own merit these merit are extraordinary this is one of his very best collection 

wheras this album primarily focus on 2 3 minute song typical of brit pop at this time elvis the attraction second album together is really work best when taken a a whole no it 's not conceptual and the music doe n't exactly flow together in any particular way nonetheless the sound doe n't alter from song to song the 13 song included here generally place the focus on costello 's new musical mission a digestion of contemporary pop of the 60 's and 70 's from the beatles to abba whom were both huge inspiration to this music say quite a lot for a genre that at this point is literally railing against phony beatlemania i guess at least this guy say past the commercial irony of it all and how both of those previously mentioned influence impact on early british new wave rock sure enough accident will happen the hit oliver 's army busy body big boy and goon squad all have a similar structure all are a slightly more full bodied pop variation of the more basic impact of his debutmy aim is trueorthis year 's model they key to this album is how even in it 's similar moment this album is very highly transitional any alligiences that elvis might 've owed musically to the punk era began to erode here and the sound move closer and closer to poppy sound' which is pretty strange because the lyrical subject matter could n't be any more punky the power struggle of militarism in society the album title is not a misnomer nevertheless there are some musical change of pace that indicate something new is on the way the arrangement of green shirt could definately be described a psychedelic while mood for modern sunday 's best and two little hitler have a very pronounced soul leaning with the kick and syncopation and the drum and all especially what 's so funny about peace love and understanding a nick lowe tune is the most obviously punl new wave song here and the hardest rocking i would'nt qualify this a costello 's greatest album in some way it 's not very diverse and result is a lot of song that kind of sound alike but it 's one of his strongest early album outside his debut and one well worth getting into 

i really love this album from beginning to end i'm surprised too i wa n't going in expecting elvis costello 's style to appeal to me for whatever reason i wa wrong i guess i assumed he wrote nothing but ballad nope in fact i'm reading right now that he had a country phase in the early 80 's which is alarming to me and i imagine old school costello fan were probably in shock over that career direction accident will happen contains a very appropriate introduction that give off the same new wave refreshing vibe that the opener from blondie 's parallel line doe i like how the verse melody contains costello 's trademark voice sung in a ballad way but complimented with an upbeat chorus strange yet fascinating combination senior service contains an upbeat rhythm for it entire 2 minute or so oliver 's army make me think of dave edmunds you know the guy who did i hear you knocking though i know him better for several other song hint hint pick up his 2 cd anthology collection of course dave wa probably influenced by elvis costello 's style and not the other way around either way i love the verse melody big boy finally indicates to me that elvis' style is that he like to take element of old school rock late 50 's and early 60 's precisely and completely revamp that style to fit the new wave period of the late 70 's early 80 's music scene it just so happens elvis is really good at it so just about every song here is memorable i even hear tom petty mannerism in this track big boy similar to refugee and american girl green shirt ha an unusually groovy verse melody that almost sound melancholy but it 's not just give off those kind of vibe i'm already convinced this man is a genius the way he can write highly memorable vocal melody and make them work no matter how he go about writing them that 's a rare talent that jeff lynne from electric light orchestra apparently ha but not just anyone can write music in such a way party girl is n't one of my favorite but i like the way the vocal sail hypnotically during the final minute goon squad ha an offbeat verse melody with a chugging rhythm giving it distinction this song is clearly awesome in every conceivable way busy body is a love song of sort haha actually it capture the southern california beach scene perfectly such a the one in san diego where yours truly ha been one of the few song where the lyric are discernible sunday 's best ha a bouncy circus like rhythm and melody not sure what to make of it other than another elvis costello experiment not a favorite but hardly terrible i wish the guitar solo at the very end lingered several second longer though i certainly sense that the lyric are meaningful but making out the word elvis is singing is hard enough let alone the meaning behind them mood for modern is short and catchy nice and effective before the first note of chemistry class i knew it would remind me of an actual chemistry class and yes the piano slow moving rhythm and elvis' vocal trick all take me back to high school just great are you ready for the final solution two little hitler ha a rhythm pace that make me think of a slow scroll through the park the chorus is really good though well i had no idea elvis costello wa anywhere this good he ha a knack for writing irresistibly catchy vocal melody and the late 70 's wa exactly the right time for elvis to arrive on the scene 

while dismissed a costello lite by some this is arguably ec 's masterpiece while retaining the feistiness of his first two album armed force showcase costello 's evolving prowess in crafting really good pop ular song 'oliver 's army' and 'what 's so funny ' shine here but there are another half dozen or so excellent cut the armed force bonus disc is likely the best in the rhino reissue series alternative version of 'busy bodies' 'accidents ' and 'goon squad' are interesting 'stranger in the house' and scorching live performance of 'lipstick vogue' and 'mystery dance' are classic excellent value here at 14 99 add another one of rhino 's 2 disc series and get free shipping 

elvis costello had a lot of gull picking the stage name elvis costello of course elvis presley is a rock and roll legend and costello is the goof from the straightman clown comedy team of bud abbott and lou costello like elvis presley and lou costello armed force contains a mix of first rate elvis presley r amp b rock a billy my funny valentine busy body and lou costello musical foolishness senior service green shirt elvis costello is quit adept at crafting powerful pop ditty with ironic lyrical reference `oliver 's army' is a light and frolicking rocker with a dramatic classical piano introduction the romantic ballad party girl chemistry class allison are melodic intense and soulful in fact the `live' recording of `accidents will happen' demonstrates elvis' clever ability to compose romance melody which are mesmerizing lyrically ambiguous and mysterious the shinning moment of armed force is the roaring and passionate rocker `what 's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding ' elvis and the attraction unleash their normally restrained temperament and charge this rocker forward with sheer abandonment not to be missed i understand that the song wa written after a barroom fight where a member of the rossington collins band punched elvis after he made a disparaging remark about ray charles at sixty four minute armed force is too long mediocre composition that subvert the momentum of the cd sunday 's best mood for modern clean money wednesday week could have been dropped still armed force contains enough material worthy of the king with an ample dose of lou 's buffoonery 

elvis costello is one of the music world 's smartest artist he also ha a gift for finding the greatest musician the bassist bruce thomas is the most innovative rock player i 've ever heard elvis' thoughtful lyric are perfectly suited to his driving band unlike most artist elvis costello ha an excess of idea in most song he also writes far too many song the extra track written at the same time are very good and are thankfully included here hat off to rykodisc for treating this artist with the respect he deserves by reissuing these recording properly other record label should learn alot from them dw 

whoa this totally rule i wo n't say if it 's better than this year 's model or not but i love it sure it cover the same ground a the first two but it 's pretty well a perfection of costello 's mix of stax volt lick raw punksih energy weird keyboard and paranoid lyric the single oliver 's army accident can happen a cover of nick lowe 's what 's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding are all the best of the album but listen closely to other song the brutal senior service paranoid goon squad satire green shirt and big boy the bouncing ironic sunday 's best and the sardonic unsparing reggae ballad two little hitler and costello 's signature sneer is in full force which certainly rule i do n't think every track is great per se but there 's a minimum number of dud party girl and busy body are far from costello 's greatest contribution to rock but they 're tolerable highly recommended 

coming off the very good second effort of this year 's model armed force represents a slightly more mellow elvis albeit with the same biting hard hitting lyric the synthesizer come more into prominence on this album which see a departure from the tom petty and the heartbreakers' type sound of the previous album and the sound is le edgy although not quite a good a the second album overall this third album is no slouch either this version of the album which come in a mini lp sleeve design which ha an almost origami type cardboard outer cover which contains a booklet with both japanese and english lyric a well a 4 picture postcard ha one of the best album cover i 've ever seen the artistic representation of a herd of elephant is simply stunning to behold the remastered sound quality is very good too this is a real treat for all elvis costello fan and is certainly a collectors' item 

at the time of it release i liked a few song but didn`t appreciate this album a a whole bought it recently because of the few good tune i remember liking only to be surprised at how good the other tune are this relates especially to what used to be b side material when record were the music medium notable track being sunday`s best and two little hitler i recently read that costello listened a great deal to abba shortly before recording this album this is evident in the fluency of the song many very catchy tune that is maybe disguised by the more organic production style the style of singing by costello is marvelous a very descriptive way of expressing the word a in add to your collection in the brilliant accident will happen the text are by the way well worth going through with a booklet in hand while listening a highly recommendable album that ha aged well a must have for anyone liking elvis costello 

costello 's first album my aim is true wa perfect his second album this year's model wa even better his third album armed force is even better than his second what we have on this album is that costello ha reached full maturity a a writer singer and in general a a human being lyrically these song are about politics look at the song title costello make all sort of political reference in his lyric some of them i understand the meaning of and some of them i do n't i do n't mean that i ca n't understand his singing quite the contrary costello is one of the most easy to understand singer that there ha ever been instead what i mean is that i simply do n't understand some of the political reference that he is making nevertheless i am able to understand his passion bitterness and anger also this album feature the best lyric writing that costello ha ever done in my opinion the lyric on this album are better than anything that bob dylan ha ever done in order to fully appreciate this album i think that it need to be viewed a the final entry in the trilogy that consists of costello 's first three album armed force represents the peak of costello a a writer and singer also the music here is performed exceptionally well the keyboard and drum and everything else are all played to perfection armed force is one of my five favorite album of all time 

costello 's signature airtight pop rock is wrapped even tighter with his third af although a bit of over effort take away from a little memorability the disc sound about equal in quality with his previously two universally praised album if anything supplementing the raw energy with compositional agility 

this album could very well be the culmination of everything elvis costello would ever be bombastic tender thoughtful political sullen and completely unmerciful i wa fortunate enough to witness the armed force tour and wa completely overwhelmed with volume and attitude for the one hour costello gave his audience the opening song of quot goon squad quot will forever reverberate in my skull this happened at a time when elvis costello literally ran neck and neck with bruce springsteen a the quot king quot and the quot bos quot duked it out for the 70 's hottest songwriter accolade unfortunately costello 's stock ha fallen and is now relegated to playing theater show and hall date with burt bacharach before pipe smoker while bruce still pack the arena with his over exuberance and in some way after reviewing armed force again the listener realizes that costello trapped himself in a seventy time warp with his over emphasis of the vox farafisa organ and a weak snare sound still the artist that is costello come through and his domination of the period is easily understood senior service goon squad two little hitler and chemistry class where costello immortalizes himself with the punishing line quot you 've been around so long but you still do n't know what to do quot demonstrate the well roundness and helter skelter manner that ha became his songwriting trademark the almost sad fact about costello is his music often time just doe n't hold up anymore sounding somewhat dated and dusty but blame it on a new wave mentality and crank up the volume because when elvis costello put forth it 's at least a more than admirable effort 

elvis costello and the attraction armed force rykodisc 8 bonus track armed force is a fun and essential album in the costello collection a great one this great album is made even better by this great bonus track cd from ryko armed force get five star the rykodisc version get six star 

i heard this album when it first wa released and wa totally impressed i had to go and buy the two that were released prior to this one and have bought each new realease that followed although i'm not crazy about almost blue painted from memory or that album with sofie von otter sorry sofie your a terrific singer the rest have been great and i still think that goodbye cruel world is terrific i played it a lot when it wa first released and still listen to it the review from above armed force wa the last title in a trilogy of album that rank with the greatest three lp series in pop rock history in retrospect it also now appears to be the one on which the young costello 's pop tendency peaked right before they began to mature and grow le accessible what about get happy i thought that album wa very accessible 

i bought this album the week it came out and a a high school tenth grader and aspiring guitarist pop songwriter it wa the wisest purchase i could have made this is a recording that shaped me musically in just so many way elvis in his early day first 5 or 6 album wa the man a far a lyric go no one else could ever be this clever with word the attraction especially bruce thomas on bass one of the best in pop were the perfect band for costello i see the live ep at hollywood high which accompanied the original lp release ha been added a part of the bonus cut long overdue and that 7 inch wa such a bad pressing this release is indescribably essential for any young aspiring modern tunesmith 

while his previous album this year 's model wa a jugular grabbing blast of new wave sneer armed force is a sumptuous musical buffet although elvis and the attraction still have an obvious affection for all thing mean and rockin' this album is just a informed by pop soul and disco a it is by rock and punk the arrangement are often lush and spacious casting aside the breathless compressed fury of this year 's model in favor of a more textured and intricate approach thankfully elvis costello is a great versatile songwriter and the attraction elvis included are a great versatile band so it all work incredibly well the lyric revolve around costello 's favorite topic bitterness jealousy paranoia fascism cynicism and of course love the result is a more varied and sensual if not necessarily better album than it predecessor and a major step forward in costello 's artistic development armed force open with the beautiful lament of accident will happen which see costello contemplating the death of a relationship while a dreamy piano driven melody twist around behind him oliver 's army is a lush candy coated gem with lyric about military propaganda sandwiched in between these two classic is the hyperkinetic unrelentingly vicious disco punk of senior service which see some ambitious young hothead gleefully contemplating a violent coup there 's also the pained prematurely sober party girl and the tense throb of green shirt mood for modern marries an infectious melody to a stomping rhythm and soul inflected vocal while sunday 's best is a sharp bitterly satirical and unsettlingly catchy classic two little hitler brings together the album 's twin theme of political and emotional oppression portraying interpersonal struggle a violent confrontation between megalomaniac and vice versa great melody too yet another fantastic addition to the costello catalogue if y'ask me 

by 1979 it seemed that elvis costello wa incapable of writing a bad record with two successful album under his belt expectation were obviously high spending a good amount of time on the road ec and the attraction were a tight unit that had only improved over time this album 's original title wa going to be emotional fascism but wa later changed to armed force and the title could n't be more perfect not only doe the album deal with global and domestic turbulence mostly in the form of dysfunctional and unsatisfying relationship but the title also work a a metaphor for the band themselves they 're tight precise and darn near flawless in execution like his two previous album costello open with a number that immediately grab you in the form of accident will happen it still remains one of his finest pop gem and it 's a personal favorite of mine right way it 's apparent that this record feature a more pop oriented sound than it predecessor and elvis make it sound easy by churning out one catchy song after another oliver 's army wa a well deserved hit and steve nieve make this track what it is his furious piano line is captivating and appealing carrying the song on a wave of pop melody that ha to be heard to be fully appreciated party girl and big boy continue the trend with bouncing melody and costello 's brilliant lyric in fact armed force might just be his one of his finest lyrical venture to date the wordplay hidden meaning contradiction and sense of unease are all tied into the record 's unifying theme that military struggle and relationship problem can be seen a one and the same it 's a bleak picture but the writing is so strong and the song are so much fun that you do n't feel guilty about singing along to a song that state i want to chop off your head and watch it roll into the basket obviously it 's not all meant to be taken seriously and costello doe a great job of mixing theme and message in such a way that you never know if he 's referring to political or personal power unraveling the lyric is part of the fun of his writing and this album is chock full of those moment green shirt is a simple number that 's complimented nicely by pete thomas' snare roll and nieve 's signature keyboard playing while bassist bruce thomas get a chance to shine on busy body and mood for modern two little hitler is another dark theme where elvis describes two people in a relationship who are constantly trying to dominate each other two little hitler will fight it out until one little hitler doe the other one 's will his pessimistic view of relationship is in full force here but you ca n't help but appreciate his brutal honesty at examining the darker and seldom seen aspect of relationship and power struggle the closer what 's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding is a memorable cover of a song by producer nick lowe to this day ec 's version is still the most famous and well known taking the irony of the song 's content and giving it a serious delivery that 's both funny and a little unsettling a well armed force along with my aim is true and this year 's model cap off a one of the best rock trilogy in history elvis still remains a great songwriter and ha gone on to deliver many other masterpiece that being said it 's hard to deny that in 1979 he and the attraction were at their peak their playing is nothing short of phenominal and costello 's songwriting wa branching out into more complex and sophisticated territory it 's a slice of pop perfection from beginning to end but it also ended up threatening to put costello into a box that would have stifled him creatively fortunately he knew what he wa doing and his next album would prove to be both a bold and successful experiment armed force is a powerful reminder that elvis and his army were here to stay 

a definite high point from the ec golden age 1977 86 ec give due notice of his ambition and the attraction respond in kind with a highly stylized nuanced tour de force that still hit where it hurt not unlike the woefully underrated trust although the golden age contains a few misstep almost blue king of america the 2 notorious l w album this is prime time prince charmless ec 

on his third album costello 's lyric are just a sweaty cynical and paranoid a ever but the music wa opening up very steadily no one would confuse this with the sort of song he wa releasing ten and fifteen year from now but there wa an unmistakable sense of flowering pop in fact there 's hardly any hint of his ahead of it time post punk style on here excepting the lyric of course but armed force doe n't suffer from it in fact it very trademark transition is what make it rank nearly on par with his first two near masterpiece senior service and accident will happen are the two best but check out the r b funk of mood for modern and the sharp lyric and attitude of the potential disaster turned marvel party girl although he 'd rarely be a good a this again he out lasted some of his populist influence the deadly punk movement and buddy holly and not just because he managed to um live best cut senior service accident will happen mood for modern party girl what 's so funny `bout peace love and undersanding sunday 's best oliver 's army green shirt goon squad 

elvis costello 's third album armed force is like all his early album inspired and full of fine song nick lowe produced costello 's first five album and thus he played a big part in securing costello artistic and commercial success in contrast to the raw and slightly punky sound of the first two album a more produced and polished sound characterizes this album you might thus well fear that costello 's music would lose some of the edge that made him interesting and relevant in the first place this is by no mean the case partly because his songwriting on this album is so strong probably the most consistent of any of his numerous album song like accident will happen and oliver 's army with it abba sound are well known classic but several of the lesser known song also have a durability that make them great listening still and song you may feel like singing along with busy body two little hitler and the magnificent chemistry class are among my absolute costello favourite in fact there is only one or two song on this highly successful album which do not quite hold level mood of the modern 's ha never really been my cup of tea and goon squad is a rather ordinary rocker a an added bonus this edition feature costello 's version of nick lowe 's legendary what 's so funny about peace love and understanding a song originally found on brinsley schwarz 's last album if you think you could settle for just one costello album armed force would be a good choice 

this disk represented a radical change for elvis costello a he and the attraction moved from the bare raw sound of this year 's model toward more layer and orchestration elvis state that they were listening to abba on the bus but do not hold that against them the cascading piano and layered key on accident 's will happen and oliver 's army still spit with bile of the angry young man sparse arrangement like mood for modern senior servitude and green shirt are mixed in giving the disk a complex series of shifting mood nick lowe 's influence a demonstrated by two little hitler nick had recorded a tune called little hitler about the same time a well a elvis' definitive cover of nick lowe 's what so funny about peace love and understanding shine throughout the release listen to the complicated word play and lyrical mastery throughout the disk a must have 

with nick lowe producing armed force turned out to be an album of very catchy tune which mask the acerbic tone of the lyric the arrangement are especially great on song like busy body green shirt and big boy my favorite track is the lilting ballad oliver 's army but every single song ha a unique pop appeal costello is amongst the most literate and versatile of rock musician and especially on this album the tight writing and clear melody are prominent whilst the attraction must be the best band he ever recorded with the new track include alternate version and live recording demonstrating his magic a a performer armed force is a classic of late 1970s punk rock but ha always been accessible to pop fan and timeless in it melodious appeal 

pop kulcher review it 's hard to pick a favorite elvis disc his debut my aim is true wa a great but rough blend of punk 's energy and traditional rock stylings imperial bedroom wa the work of a mellowed mature songwriter and everything in between wa an evolution of sort i happen to be loyal to armed force just because it is so tightly packed with great pop rock tune from his cover of nick lowe 's quot what 's so funny 'bout peace love amp understanding quot to his anti war anthem quot oliver 's army quot not a dull moment in the set the attraction are at their best their tight musicianship meshing perfectly with elvis 's well crafted tune of his many great album this one doe the best job of bridging elvis 's angry young punk sensibility with the more restrained melodrama which would come to dominate later album and the folk at rykodisc have worked wonder with the sound while adding numerous bonus track 

elvis costello armed force 1979 this music is undeniably good very tuneful melodious costello ha a really cool voice the bassist is very good so why am i not crazy about this music it 's a question of taste overall i find it too chirpy too cutesy for my liking i especially dislike the keyboard which are a little too dominant and add a sort of goofy circus like quality that doe n't turn me on sometimes the organ fill remind me of church music or something along those line which i'm not crazy about true costello 's lyric are witty biting cynical and clever the peppy music serf a a nice contrast to his word costello is sometimes associated with punk rock probably because of the timing of his debut album more than anything else but his music is n't really like that especially not this album armed force is more like new wave old school r b if you had to label it the song i like the most is the most rockin' one what 's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding and understandably one of costello 's most popular tune mood for modern is also very catchy i can hear the bowie influence on that one which elvis himself refered to in the liner note which are written by the man himself and quite entertaining i actually like a fair amount of costello 's music watching the detective pump it up brilliant mistake i'm just more picky about which one appeal to me so i guess i do n't really qualify a a fan on the bonus disk the extra studio song are good and would 've easily been at home on armed force the live stuff is good too with more than decent version of alison and detective though i still prefer the original the crowd is very enthusiastic i really like the last one chemestry class which costello doe solo it 's nice to be able to hear his guitar so clearly for a change p s to the die hard fan who ca n't handle a different p o v i apologize for expressing this honest and objective opinion i realize the main point of this forum is for fan like you to excessively praise everything the artist you love have released peace 

sinking like robert smith still a good it 's elvis costello gone totally nut now he doe n't snarl or gnash his teeth so much i hope you 're happy now i think he 's starting to mean it 

let 's think about this the first three elvis costello album were released in succession with a year for all of them being recorded they are all the same quality of song with minor upgrade in technique across the year i am not implying that any one is better than another one they are a good set of album for the music poetry lover in fact the best course of action would be to just buy all three i find them complementary a well a music for the time this review ha nothing to do with the lovely female friend i mentioned in my last ec album review that 's really my opinion 

and pay attention to elvis it is packed full of great pop new wave punk track this album made it clear that elvis it a great unique talent and that he could consistently write song of uncommon quality this album probably formed the basis or rocket booster to his subsequent song writing career this genre is not one that i am normally drawn to but these are great song good album cover too the original vinyl album had square color post card inside and a strange and annoying 4 fold opening system oliver 's army and watching the detective were hit single from the album but ever song on the album wa good enough to be a single a rare feat 

armed force wa elvis and the attractions' claustrophobic pop masterpiece loaded with melody and paranoia fueled by cramped touring van hotel room and long stretch of listening to abba kraftwerk bowie and the beatles while driving between gig it wa also the last of the elvis album that mirrored the tightly wound image cliched angry young man singer songwriter of the new wave world it also happens to be one of the most indispensable album of the 70 's song like oliver 's army and two little hitler brimmed with neo fascist imagery and highly charged sexual emotional content yet flourished with pop hook accident will happen portrays a barely apologetic philanderer a he try to explain the infidelity of his life and us one of early elvis' frequent description of romantic partner a a victim think of how many time that word appears on his first three album many of the song bear unmistakable ominous threatening quality like the roar of goon squad the hushed fear that underscore green shirt and the implied threat of they took me in the office and told me very carefully the way that i could benefit from death and disability from senior service nick lowe deserves a good deal of the credit for keeping this album in check and when is he going to get into the rock and roll hall of fame it is likely his pop sophistication that gave some of armed force levity in it darkest point it is also lowe 's one song and the first cover to appear on a proper ec album that brings the relentlessly downward outlook to a more optimistic close what 's so funny about peace love and understanding wa the kind of song that once elvis claimed it a his own provided a banner to his part during the formation of rock against racism unfortunately for this reissue rhino 's 2002 double cd issue wa also the cd that most justified rhino 's double disc reissue of elvis' work armed force is the kind of album that more than hold it own a a singular entity and the ryko release that tacked the bonus selection on the same disc distracted from that sense of piece to me so to have some excellent material on a bonus disc is just cream on the berry especially since it included the entire live at hollywood high recording a opposed to the three song bonus vinyl that wa included in the original album if it wa possible to add a bonus star to an already 5 star album rhino managed that trick that is the essential armed force i understand that the right to the ec cbs year catolog have turned over once again but the double cd is really worth seeking out 

one of costello 's richest most diverse album armed force stand a a masterpiece full of rich melody and witty songwriting it 's also a strong rock album that doe n't shy away from controversey although mired in controversey himself at the time he got into a fight with stephen still and his band over nasty comment about ray charles it wa costello idiotically provoking a musical rival costello proved that he wa n't the racist he wa accused of being and in fact apologized for the impetuous stupid comment costello wa mistakenly identified a a racist because of this incident many of the song particularly oliver 's army reflect the exact opposite regardless the brilliance of the writing and production along with the sharp performance make this a classic worth keeping this edition of armed force is n't a cheat the second disc alone ha more than enough material for a new album it includes most of the hollywood high show previously available a a three track ep a well a such minor classic a tiny step also included are a number of alternate version of classic song and b side issued with the original single the sound quality is comparable if slightly better by my estimation the value added portion of the program is the stunning live track from hollywood high on the second disc there 's also extensive liner note explaining both the circumstance that went into the writing and making of the album the lyric include alternate lyric a well for some of the demo 

maybe it 's because i grew up around country music that i find so much in this album to like it 's kind of a good not so good thing really in the early 1980 's elvis the attraction were doing really good and doing a lot of growing musically by the time this came out elvis got the idea in his head that his next move would be to record in nashville okay on the surface this is n't exactly something you 'd expect but hey let 's face it elvis costello is n't and wa n't someone given to punk clishes so it 's best to expect the unexpected where an album likearmed forcesis great it 's really what you 'd expect from costello here he bought in doobie brother pedal steel player john mcfee and proceeded to record a dozen tune by people like hank williams george jones and gram parson okay so we have elvis doing an album of country cover but it really doe n't end there william 's why don' you love me like you used to is given a revved up modern rockabilly treatment and end all too soon and besides that sittin thinkin' and honey hush rock out pretty hard really they 've got the country feeling but that brash new wave attack so it 's all a good mixture there is one thing about this album that i do n't know if will be to everyone 's taste a the title suggests most of these song do tend towards twanky nashville fare with a lot of tale of drinking and broken heart in short the country music clishe so are we getting elvis trading in one clishe with another not really he give these song a very sincere rendering and even if his whole additude is usually a angry and pointed a they come he somehow manages to convey the depressing bluesy outlook of some of these tune with a dry eye this version of the cd is a country oriented live set from aberdeen these are song that did n't appear on the album and are a pretty good bonus okay so this album derailed elvis 's career and always get either terrible or overly complimentary review so i 'll say it 's not perfect but the album itself is worth your time if you are an open minded elvis costello fan 

i love this release by elvis i take it a a tribute to the singer songwriter that inspired him the selection and arrangement make this a solid country venture for mr costello 

i think this is an album where either you 're into it or you are n't it is n't an issue of whether it 's a good record or a bad one a a fan of costello 's early work a well a a fairly well informed country fan i 've found this to be an album that 's grown on me over the year he knew what is wa doing and he did it well dj joe sixpack slipcue guide to country music 

quot why do n't you love me like you used to do quot and quot how much i 've lied quot the tune that open and close this collection respectively are bold affecting interpretation but the one that come between them are misguided poorly performed horror the whole thing 's like bad sandwhich tasty bread but the middle 's just junk food 

excellent this is elvis costello and the attraction venture into country music this is a legendary double disc cd it wa produced by the legendary nashville producer billy sherril disc one you get 12 great song some highlight why don't you love me like you used to do a hank williams classic i'm your toy hot burrito 1 this is the gram parson's flying buritto brother classic disc two 27 song highlight stranger in the house with george jones we oughta be ashamed with johnny cash both of these are studio recording you also get 7 more live song then more studio song then 5 more live song recoreded at legendary palomino club it includes a live version of i'm you toy the flying buritto brother classic this is great one folk and i highly recommend it if you can find one available this is great country rock or cosmic american music a the legendary gram parson would call it 

this record wa probably the beginning of the end for costello the conflicted song conqueror apparantly his television duet with george jones the b side stranger in the house pumped a bit too much nashville into his vein the song on this album which have worked for countless other american singer do n't gel with costello 's voice or his band the attractions' style add hack production from country veteran billy sherrill and this compilation end up completely disasterous it 's a pity because costello wa coming off such a huge record with quot imperial bedroom quot only to release this mess perhaps if elvis had used a country band ala clover from my aim is true there 's a chance he may have been more insprired but englishman simply cannot quot do quot country not even the gifted declan macmanus besides if he wanted to release a c amp w record he would have been better off using the excellent quot king of america quot to support this desire that album which featured american james burton and ron tutt contained all original material and displayed the flair and performance costello seemingly always strives for the quot almost blue quot outing is a muddy and boring mess the reason i say this is costello when covering a tune usually match or better the performance of the original artist in each of these example he fall miserably short poorly planned and poorly executed quot almost blue quot may serve a an adequate primer for the unsophisticated new wave listener unfamiliar with country but for those who have heard the original it 's pretty painful i think even elvis costello would have to agree with that assessment 

for all you costello completists out there do not toss your rykodisc copy once you get this new rhino version there are two live in aberdeen track on the ryko pressing that did not get carried over onto the new one a for the record itself when i first bought the vinyl 20 year ago i knew very few of the song and had none of the original version now i have almost all of them a well a a deep appreciation for country music i have elvis and my wife to thank for that 

first off i love the warning label in the liner note this album contains country western music may produce radical reaction in narrow minded people further more i'm afraid i disagree with any previous reviewer who cite this is the 1st misstep in a career that wa consistantly on the rise on the contrary i think almost blue wa the 1st time costello completely stumped his audience he 's certainly done it a few time since it take real ball to put your own stamp on a hank williams tune albeit a relatively obscure one opening with why do n't you love me costello company immediately put a spin into their own conceit throwing themselves into the proceeding with the same hyper punked out abandon found on this year 's model this is your 1st indication that this is n't going to be your typical country standard album or at worse a joke fact of the matter is he truly go for the throat on this one his take on sweet dream may make patsy cline fan cringe in their beehive but any gram parson affecionado will appreciate costello 's heartfelt rendition of hot burrito 1 i'm your toy or how much i lied both are just a touching a the original sung a if he 'd written them himself good year for the rose wa the big surprise hit on this album in england at any rate personally i never get sick of hearing it and i love the original a bonus disc go rhino mr costello have once again given you an all too generous assortment for your buck infact there 's more than twice a many track than on the original album it start off with his legendary duet with george jones on stranger in the house it doe n't disappoint followed by an even odder pairing with the man in black i wo n't comment on the result but the moment is to be cherished besides some live track from his infamous gig in aberdeen there 's not one but 2 chilling version of leon payne 's psycho where others have milked the tune 's black humor for all it 's worth costello wisely take it all too seriously a welcomed restraint that will send a shiver up your spine best version i 've ever heard i ca n't believe they left it off the album the bonus disc also feature some very touching version of too far gone he 's got you not to mention real gem like wondering blue keep calling his version of i 'll take care of you is to die for then there 's your angel step out of heaven i 'll bore you if i go on if i have n't already many costello fan will begrudgingly look on this a a novelty but far from necessary in term of their collection the superficial mass will cast this aside without a 2nd thought but for me it top flawed classic like punch the clock or his overrated burt bacharach album for that matter in fact having been a longtime costello not so lately secret country fan for year i breathed a sigh of relief when this originally came out ofcourse it did n't set the world on fire i had to keep my dirty little secret to myself but without a doubt almost blue is one of the most interesting record of costello 's ongoing career for my money it 's certainly one of the most rewarding reissue in this rhino series a much a i 've always loved this album truth be told it 's the bonus disc that sends this into the 5 star mark in other word i'm happy to have bought it again 

i do n't know i loved ec and i loved country i even went to see him on the tour afterwards what a waste of my precious time back then and of my money this is self indulgent and badls played i do not understand the point really buy some real country instead george jones johnny cash anything instead 

after releasing the brilliant trust in 1981 elvis costello wasted no time in releasing a second album that same year elvis had made it clear through his work that he wa no stranger to experimentation and reinvention yet few could have seen this record coming a cover album of classic country tune it wa a gutsy move that despite the mixed result gave u another side of elvis costello that would manifest itself on many future recording costello had toyed with country sound on previous record especially on my aim is true but this album found him taking it on full force all 12 cut on this album are cover and although done well they 're not a interesting a his original material still there are some fine performance from ec and the attraction there are some energetic number like why do n't you love me like you used to do honey hush and tonight the bottle let me down these are a lot of fun but some of the slower track work too especially success sweet dream and how much i lied however the real standout here is his fantastic and delicate cover of jerry chestnut 's good year for the rose first made famous by george jones costello 's cover is incredible and after seeing him perform it live a few year ago i 've grown to love it even more if there 's one reason you should buy this album it 's purely for that track alone the others are well done but that song is easily the highlight there 's really not too much to add because since these song are cover there are no lyric or classic costello melody to delve into in some way that 's the record biggest flaw it 's elvis but without a lot of the charm and sophistication that accompanies his other album almost blue is by no mean a bad record in fact for people who are n't fan of country like me this is a great place to start it 's old school but never in your face or obnoxious the performance are tight and it 's evident that costello not only know more about country music than many of today 's country artist but he respect it and love it storytelling and melancholy theme it 's just elvis having fun covering some of his favorite country song no more and no le it 's not a place for the newcomer or casual fan to start but if you 're in the mood for a different side of elvis then it 's worth hearing every now and then 

costello 's country excursion work well because of the excellent song he chose his voice is suited to the genre and the attraction give it all they 've got supported by some brilliant nashville musician like john mcfee on lead and pedal steel guitar and tommy miller on violin this enhanced album includes a wealth of extra track mostly live version the fast paced why do n't you love me like you used to do sound more like early rock 'n roll than country to me whilst sweet dream is done with feeling and lot of soul success is a gently lilting ballad with lovely piano my favourite are the buoyant tonight the bottle let me down the moving colour of the blue this slow version of too far gone and especially the bittersweet good year for the rose a brilliant interpretation costello 's country excursion reminds me of another highly successful country album by a uk artist marianne faithfull 's very authentic faithless also available a dreamin' my dream almost blue obviously wo n't appeal to all elvis costello fan but i find it a pleasure to listen to and a worthy contribution to the genre 

i love country music the real stuff the kind elvis attempt here i also love elvis costello for the past week i have listened incessantly to his collaboration with burt bacharach painted from memory so with that a a perspective i have to say that this may be the weakest effort in the entire elvis catalog getting billy sherrill in nashville surely wa the right thing to do but these song do n't click and about none of these cover can stand along side the original i ca n't specifically carp about the playing or the vocal but where they fail is in capturing the heart the spirit the feel of country music they sound too much like an experiment year later van morrison another giant would fail in a similar effort for sure this is not a bad album but there are 20 better collection that elvis ha recorded and thousand of better country album 

it 's funny to see how almost blue still divide costello fan after all these year i remember seeing a documentary produced for british tv melvyn bragg 's the south bank show that chronicled costello and the attractions' nashville adventure producer billy sherrill after displaying a lot of initial skepticism responded to elvis' pumped up version of why do n't you love me like you used to do with a reaction like now we 're getting somewhere that 's why i took on this project elvis meanwhile had confessed to the camera how nervous he wa about going into the studio and letting sherrill hear what he and the gang had done to the track detractor aside almost blue hold up a a classic collection of country cover packed with more drinking and heartbreak than most pasty punk rocker could endure and the first of many mostly successful musical digression in costello 's illustrious career standout track why do n't you love me like you used to do i'm your toy brown to blue a good year for the rose how much i lied 

it probably seemed like a good idea in retrospect elvis wanted to go to nashville and meet with an icon of a country classic producer then cut an album of some of his favorite right there in music city and after cutting some of excellent single in a country format radio sweetheart being one almost blue really could have been a great record instead it wa elvis' first big misstep of his stellar career he failed to understand the hack mentality of the nashville scene and almost blue is the sound of a 9 to 5 producer billy sherrill trying to shoehorn a band of randy brit into a paint by number sound while the album kick off like it should why do n't you love me like you used to the ensuing album find the band in a straightjacket the sole exception naturally were the ballad good year for the rose brown to blue and how much i lied the rest of almost blue then struggle to get out from under the limitation it left elvis and the attraction who had spent those first three album exposing themselves a a volatile high energy creative force suddenly blanded into cookie cutter recording robbed of an album worth hearing more than a a vanity project 

pretty much every rock fan know about the the early history of elvis costello frommy aim is trueto whatever he happens to have been doing in the last decade from collaberations with burt bacharach and allen toussaint to one or two maybe classical project either way around it this one seems to have gotton away from me i had no idea he recorded it none of the song seem at all familiar and it look like i am definately not the only one who feel that way so whatever costello wa obviously pretty content at this point to hang on 180 here because this album doesn look or sound like any elvis costello the attraction album before it if you want to make the obvious beatles comparasin it 's one worth making though you could look at his previous albumtrustand this a being like therevolver uk andsgt pepper 's lonely heart club bandof his career both these album found costello following the same musical path with a very gradual transition from 3 minute pop to something more psychedlic had it all been done no this wa very very different with this album elvis achieved something that wa not only thought next to impossible with some strong exception but that would help influence the world of brit pop for decade he wa able to integrate the concept of psychedelic effect into song that were not only very strong but under 5 minute the last four song on thealbum a well a the percussive opener beyond belief pidgin english you little fool and especially town cryer give you lot 's of string leslie amp echo here and there the work but in the hand of new producer geoff emmerick it 's not very clished you never know what 's coming next on the other hand there are some moment where other style tried on earlier album really come into great focus shabby doll is a great song very soulful and very funky especially the bassline at the end if the previous album had elvis costello 's singing wa going too in new direction this really take the cake up and down from song to song he is leaping into this really very sexy high alto i would'nt call it falsetto a it seems very natural almost blue is just beautiful it 's the title of his very last album but this torchy jazz ballad is definately one of his unsung classic same go for the soulful human hand the long honeymoon kid about it little savage well many of thing song are able to be pretty straight ahead and still be innovative so sure it 's forgotton and i 'd bet some people give this a good review simply for that purpose that just because an album is obscure then it 's gotta be good well that is never entirely true but this is a very strong exception to the rule a well a being the best place to find the groun zero where post punk pop met up with well where the music 's gone pretty much today in a lot of way 

double dipping is okay i suppose normally i 'd be vehemently opposed to triple dipping re re releasing an artist 's work but since most of my elvis costello cd were stolen last year rhino 's reissuing of the entire ec catalog is a welcome idea to me and one that is accomplishing the seemingly impossible task of improving on rykodisc 's similar reissue project rhino is apparently reissuing elvis' entire recorded output unlike rykodisc he 's not just reissuing the columbia year and releasing them three at a time roughly twice a year in no discernible order it seems the best thing about rhino 's project is that every release is a two disc package with all the bonus material on disc two this make for quite a lot of bonus material imperial bedroom wa a higly welcome reissue i first bought the vinyl copyof this masterpiece in 1986 then i bought the columbia cd in 1993 and the rykodisc version in 2000 it seems like the fourth time 's the charm for those of you not familiar with this album it wa released in 1982 to wide critical acclaim the lush production and strong songwriting make it in my opinion one of elvis' best and most certainly his most intelligent the album 's been a part of my life for 16 year and i know the thing backwards and forward the moody beyond belief the epic beautiful man out of time the latin tinged accordian fueled long honeymoon steve neive 's psychotic orchestration on and in every home and that 's just part of side one the rhino disc two is a veritable treasure trove for anyone interested in this album there 's ton of alternate early version of oterwise great song giving them an intersting new edge kid about it is pared down a bit little savage is given an r b ballad shot in the arm beyond belief wa originally named the land of give and take with slightly different lyric town cryer is given a fast paced disco treatment making it sound like an abba song that description may sound like sacrilege to an ec fan but believe me it sound great there 's lot of stuff that wa also featured on the original ryko bonus track section like the cover of smokey robinson 's head to toe the gleeful upbeat i turn around and the unused waltz like title track a lot of this stuff is also familiar to long time fan in the form of various b side and compilation album like the excellent out of our idiot collection die hard ec fan from back in the day will be in heaven rediscovering this classic in a new light new ec fan will also be very happy with this purchase i ca n't imagine anyone not liking imperial bedroom rhino 's version make ignoring this classic even more of a crime 

costello fan will likely brand me a heretic but 'bedroom' seems to me to be one of his more overrated recording 'beyond belief' and 'man out of time' certainly rate consideration in a 'best of' compilation 'long honeymoon' 'human hands' and 'every home' are somewhat interesting however beyond that i find little that 's especially compelling here there are treat on the bonus disc that i enjoy more than much of the original 'bedroom' recording thanks in part to steve nieve 's scorching work on the ivory in fact the alternative version of 'the town where time stood still' and the toe tap inducing from head to toe merit inclusion on my desert island list of elvis favorite 

the true test of good costello is do you find the song running through your head hour later with this album i find one whole side buzzing in my head the second in cd land where there is no side this mean song 8 and up quot pidgin english quot ha one line that slide so gracefully over one held synthsizer note that it 's unforgettable you 'll know what i mean when you come to it keeping the song short yet substantial costello work a if he were writing for 78 's and the sound resembles that somewhat lot of piano yet not really nostalgic either i do n't find the first side a compelling and yet quot and in every home quot is so charming that it almost redeems it timneless all in all this is the one costello album with an infinite sell by date 

elvis ha long admitted to being a beatles fan of course going a far a calling them the greatest band ever in rolling stone and this is the closest he got to embracing the fab four 's occasional dipping into classical rock that is rock influenced by classical music i'm not trying to invent a new phrase for classic rock the result is an odd but mostly satisfying effort i say mostly because sometimes he go totally overboard in place making you little fool town cryer pidgin english and and every home sound treacly overloading them with harpsichord string baroque piano flute clarinet bassoon lute hautboy kazoo okay i made a couple of those up overproduced well yeah but that 's part of it charm i guess you could say and more often than not it 's a classic take the cynical beyond belief or the ballad almost blue and man out of time shabby doll tear before bedtime and the long honeymoon which ha the only accordion part i 've ever heard that i can honestly say i like are n't a prominent a those three but they have the same feel and are just a good and costello 's lyricism and immortal melodicism are diminished however there are at least two better costello record out there maybe three my favorite elvis album are the first three and this one and i can honestly say at least this year 's model and armed force and probably my aim is true are better so this is quite good but do n't start here 

this together with next year 's model are my two favourite elvis album and this album is probably the best representative of his later work and is a creative highpoint this version ha been very well remastered for a brilliant sound and the mini lp sleeve packaging is a work of art in itself with both the japanese and english lyric included a an insert bearing little resemblence to his early punk day the track here are a lot longer and take more time to develop i do n't know where amazon got it track information from but believe me this album only ha the first 15 track that they listed however this is still overall a brilliant album with every track worthy of being on a best of compilation album of elvis costello my favourite track which wa also a small hit single is you little fool but others like town cryer and man out of time are also standout track if you are looking for the best of elvis' later and earlier work look no further than this and next year 's model highly recommended 

ah the cd age who 'd ever thought that when i excitedly picked up this album in the summer of '82 that i would purchase it four count 'em four more time ok the second time i puchased it wa spur of the moment there i wa eating at the hibachi a great japanese restaurant in kansa city killing time by treating my taste bud before seeing elvis at the starlight theater in the summer of '83 all of the sudden in walk elvis costello with his entourage did i know that elvis loved good japanese food well of course but who 've thought it anyway after a moment of excited discussion on the strategy of approaching e c for his autograph with my then wife diane and her brother jeff it wa decided that jeff and i would run to the nearest music store to procure a couple of elvis album and diane would keep him at the hibachi using any charm necessary jeff bought a copy of his latest punch the clock while i purchased the masterpiece imperial bedroom we arrived back the hibachi our food getting cold on the table while e c wa quickly consuming his we ate quickly while deciding how we were to approach the man during this unending dicussion elvis and entourage got up to leave and we paniced allowing e c to walk on by without a word however bruce thomas noticed the album on the table and stopped elvis and motioned back to u elvis grudgingly turned around and humored yet another starstruck fan we did have a short conversation he signed the album and left yep still have my autographed imperial bedroom never played half a decade later columbia issued i b on cd and i absolutely believing that anything on cd would sound better than it lp counterpart purchased it immediately then came the 90 and the remastered reissue madness rykodisc acquired e c s columbia catalog and reissued this one in 1994 did i have to have it absolutely and it did sound considerably better than the columbia release and it had nine bonus track well i finally could stop spending money on this album right wrong barely 7 year pas and rhino the king of reissue get hold of elvis' entire back catalog i resist buying e c s album yet again until this one come out this time there is an entire bonus disc that ha 23 bonus track that 's just insane so i shell out to buy this album for the 5th time is it worth it well the remastering differs only so slightly from the ryko remaster just a litte more of that crispness that bill inglot is so known for the ryko remaster is a bit subtler and for this album i think i prefer it but i 'll state again the difference are all but un noticable so if you 're buying this hoping for some remarkable sonic upgrade you 'll be disappointed but the bonus stuff is a different story if you 're an elvis fan these track are both entertaining and illuminating different lyric different arrangement really make one appreciate the final product all the more ex beatles' engineer geoff emerick get it all right with plenty of beatle esque orchestral touch at all the right place a masterpiece well yes and this ha got to be the last reissue right 

listen to the opening line of the loved one and you hear costello at his best snappy line sung with force and definitely dripping with caustic wit then we hit the piano noodling and the song start to drift away from me the cd is filled with moment like this great lyric and a solid melody often lost amidst overproduced musical adornment stripped down this is some of costello 's best stuff song that walk the fine line between emotion and intellect but every time i feel like i get close to the heart of the song i feel lost in the middle of music that serf no purpose this is definitely worth a listen and i still enjoy popping it in the machine but i feel some of his other work is more deserving of the high praise given imperial bedroom 

there 's not a whole lot to add to the previously posted review in spite of columbia 's audacious masterpiece ad campaign at the time of the original lp 's release imperial bedroom is probably worthy of being called a masterpice if nothing else it wa dramatically different from just about everything else that came out in 1982 the sound quality of the rhino reissue is perhaps a tad fuller than the ryko reissue but the difference are mostly subtle the extra bonus material mostly serf to illustrate why the alternate version did n't make the album though it 's great to finally be able to hear the sped up version of man out of time that survived a the intro and outro of the album version oddly enough even the expanded liner note do n't reveal too much more than the note for the ryko edition which were already longer than those costello penned for most of the previous ryko reissue still if you 've got the ryko reissue of imperial bedroom the new liner note do make a good case for picking up the rhino edition 

almost 27 year since it initial release i find i keep coming back to this album i must confess it wa the 1st costello record i bought we 're talking 1985 here it made enough of an impact for me to tear through everything that came before it with relish abandon in short it made a fan out of me among costello devotee there is obviously a healthy ongoing debate a to which album deserve classic status by large most agree imperial bedroom is on that list the costello admirer who hoist their fickle disdain on the like of man out of time are few far between the fact that legendary jazz trumpet great chet baker covered almost blue to his dying day might also make one think twice a to it 's merit a lot of ink ha been spilled on the beatlesque production courtesy of geoff emerick the man who twiddled the nob on a little album called sgt pepper 's but one thing that seems to set bedroom apart from it predecessor is the fact that this is an album costello pretty much composed on the piano rather than the guitar more than anything that preceded it cocktail lounge cabaret rogers hart musical stylings take precedence over 1 2 3 4 rock roll all of which might just account for any cry of he 's lost his edge yet regardless of the lavish chirpy production or the absurd gershwin comparison bedroom received the sentiment of the song are a dark jaded a ever here domestic unrest meet morning after malaise the infectious insult flattery of beyond belief soon give way to the eviscerating self portrait of shabby doll the best way to sum up might be all the string in the world could n't put humpty dumpty back together again personally i do n't find a single dud among bedroom 's 15 track and while man out of time almost blue are usually on any given greatest hit compilation lesser known great like human hand pidgin english need not be overlooked for all it seemingly sophisticated studio trickery costello 's liner note reveal it actually took 3 attraction to play the 1 accordion on long honeymoon one to hold it in place another to work the bellow while steve nieve played the keyboard so perhaps punk is not dead after all despite this little footnote imperial bedroom is without a doubt one of costello 's most elegant concise album i suppose a case could also be made for it being one of his most self obsessed but for me he rise above the fray of his own self conflict in a way we all can relate to while a bit of a flop in it day columbia advertised the album with one word masterpiece much to costello 's embarrassment for this discerning fan the answer is simple yes 

elvis costello had gotten u used to better than this this is around the era when i started to lose interest in him completely 

here it is elvis costello 's magnum opus and arguably his finest album imperial bedroom is a sprawling and epic piece of work that find costello at his creative and contemplative best it 's an ambitious effort that thanks in large part to beatles producer geoff emerick succeeds on every level and it took elvis costello and the attraction further than they 'd ever gone before the first striking thing about this album is the sound itself it ha a warm and inviting atmosphere that immediately draw you in the song have much more breathing room and feel more laid back than they did on any previous ec album there 's no doubt that emerick is responsible for this he take costello 's song and give them a life of their own while still allowing costello and the band to work their magic it 's slick and more restrained with a gentle warmness that flow effortlessly through every song beyond belief is another gem in a long line of great album opener and immediately the album 's production set in giving the song a wide open atmosphere while making it intimate at the same time the poppy tear before time immediately follows and give keyboardist steven nieve a chance to shine with some unique sound this is really an album where he get plenty of time in the spotlight both on the keyboard and a a conductor and arranger for the various string arrangement sprinkled throughout the record the soft accordion and piano melody of the long honeymoon is a perfect companion to costello 's lyric a story about a young wife who 's waiting for her husband to call or come home yet ca n't bring herself to actually pick up the phone and face the fear that he may be having an affair with her best friend it 's the kind of twisted tale only elvis can weave so eloquently almost blue is one of costello 's most famous song a gentle piano ballad with a smoky blue feel the fanfare trumpet of and in every home completely take you by surprise but they fit the song so well that they quickly feel second nature and it 's one more nice production touch that set this album apart from anything elvis had recorded before the fast paced little savage is an exhilarating ride while the loved one contains a lyric revealing the original title for the album ppsiloveyou the album 's closer is the beautiful town cryer complete with nieve 's delicate piano and a soaring orchestra that brings the entire album together and leaf an indelible impression i have to save a paragraph for the album 's true highlight and one of the most devastating song in ec 's library man out of time what 's really interesting is that the track both begin and end with an earlier and rougher version of the song these bookend take you by surprise because the final cut of the song is sandwiched in the middle and is far superior and much more polished the pop melody is incredibly bright and catchy while the word paint a picture that could be a autobiographical a they are allegorical the entire album should be heard from beginning to end but if you absolutely must hear only one track from the record it 's this one without a doubt despite the fact that it wa met with some commercial and critical indifference upon the time of it release imperial bedroom ha gone on to become one of costello 's most beloved and acclaimed album from it glossy production to it colorful cover art everything about this record is sheer perfection the attraction are flawless a always and costello 's word and music are a bit more open and optimistic which result in a fresh experience that is n't easy to forget all 15 track flow together effortlessly and the whole album should be heard from beginning to end it 's like a movie where every scene is important and to not see the whole thing would greatly hurt the experience in fact this album is my second favorite ec album only behind all this useless beauty from an artistic standpoint this may just be his brightest and best this is one of the most stirring and beautiful record of the past 50 year own it hear it and experience it time and time again 

i had some trouble sharing others' enthusiasm for imperial bedroom when it wa first released in 1982 the album wa of course in many way a return to costello 's original starting point after the for me very disappointing almost blue album compared to trust and get happy though the number are generally more produced and stylistically the album spread out over many genre however my original appeal against imperial bedroom wa that i thought there were only few really good track later i have had to revise my opinion because there are actually more great song i remember that the only track that really made an impression on me were shabby doll and long honeymoon i still think well of shabby doll while long honeymoon ha not lasted for me on the other hand there are a handful among the other song that stand out positively the loved one is a catchy song that well could have stemmed from costello 's perhaps best album armed force the same description could fit little savage which probably is my favorite track on the album man out of time you little fool and the somewhat heavily produced ballad town cryer also stand out there are also a couple of real disappointment the two dusty springfield pastiche almost blue and kid about it can be hard to swallow conclusion in several way an uneven album that contains fine number but which a a whole doe not measure up to costello 's best to be fair it should be mentioned that costello vocally is on top and he show great versatility 

i came upon elvis costello 's imperial bedroom by way of a rolling stone article something along the line of the best 100 album of this century and sure enough costello 's imperial bedroom made the cut i already wa a big fan with a greatest hit tape that introduced me to allison and pump it up imperial bedroom is pretty steeped in the 80 's though it contains some memorable song the general tenor is symphonic jazzy flowing number for some reason it did n't strike a chord with me like other costello and the attraction work i 've come to know and love granted almost blue and beyond belief rank right up there with costello 's best the album stay on the surface slick and sleepy torchy and touched granted it wa hard to live up to the expectation set forth by making a rolling stone top 100 list but with the like of elvis costello it wa possible i believe you should give costello his due the man is ultra talented and know his way around a song but unless you are drawn to the more pop ish polished side of elvis go elsewhere if you need some peace love and understanding and do n't mind some of the sameness give imperial bedroom a whirl just do n't get your expectation up too high unless you are a seal crossed with burt bacharach fan if you are first seek counseling next get imperial bedroom it 's only bound to make the condition exasperated not bad for a sleepy friday night date under candle light but other than that the bed ai n't spinning it 's imperial after all mmw 

a others have written here this is the album that bridge elvis v1 0 and declan v1 0 whether it 's the masterpiece where black and white turn to color i e the beatles' revolver is often debated for my money this is the best that elvis dec would do for at least the next 15 year his subsequent work imho being dabblings in this genre or that this would have been 5 star but my ear are still bleeding from the horrible early digital on the original release mastered on the cbs discomputer rhino ha done an admirable job of de digitizing this album 

i wa a new ec fan a few year ago coming in with 1996 's quot all this useless beauty quot and hanging around since then a longtime manic fan gave me two word of advice quot get 'brutal youth' and 'imperial bedroom' quot i did great song here with quot man out of time quot and quot the loved one quot being my favorite the liner note are wonderful a are the extra track this of course is in reference to the 1994 demon re issue wonderful 

i remember reading an interview in 1982 where elvis costello expressed his desire to have someone like frank sinatra cover his tune a opposed to linda ronstadt out of that urge came imperial bedroom and it show wonderfully whether elvis costello wa simply maturing or just displaying a side of his songwriting talent that he had to suppress for so long i could n't say but imperial bedroom wa certainly an ambitious and far reaching album quot man out of time quot quot shabby doll quot and quot beyond belief quot are incredibly brilliant composition that frankly stunned me back in 1982 i could n't get over the mix of sophistication and drama in these melody while i knew costello wa incredibly talented i honestly did n't know he had such range i do n't think that ol' blue eye even bothered to listen to anything on this album seriously doubt it but for my money just for the first few song alone this cd is worth every penny 

costello wanted his music to be a complex a his lyric which increasingly documented marital tension so for his seventh album he and beatles engineer geoff emerick experimented with an adult sonic palette accordion mellotron horn that highlighted grown up stress and sorrow 

when imperial bedroom first hit the shelf critic were falling over themselves with superlative even columbia 's artist masterpiece ad campaign wa begging the question wa this the album that would crack the new wave stereotype that had been hung around elvis costello 's neck since my aim is true the answer wa yes and no granted hiring geoff emerick to put his beatle esque touch made for a handsome rich sound more than any other album in ec 's discography the expansiveness paid off right from the album 's opener beyond belief toying with his own range and the overlapping vocal part elvis' willingness to experiment rocked the foundation of all the early punk of the period think of how closely joe jackson 's night and day and the police 's synchronicity followed the experiment were also inherent to the arrangement the high pitched string that slip out of the album 's fade to town cryer were four cello overdubbed to sound like an entire string section a i recall working from the pretext that they could experiment like the beatles did each song wa tinkered and toyed with till a you can hear in the comparison to the bonus disc 's demo version they barely resembled their original idea it made the original album 's side one a song suite of near sgt pepper proportion with the standout of man out of time marking the perfect bridge between the elvis of old and the elvis of new his anguished howl that break the song open and then usher it into the heartbreak of almost blue reset the boundary of composition in 1982 comparison to gershwin and porter were also being tossed around when imperial bedroom first came out one suspect they had more to do with overzealous critic trying to make association with serious music than to the obvious merit of elvis' songwriting prowess the debt to tin pan alley the long honeymoon is truly there but the lyrical jab and jibe are still pure costello and a line like in a private detective overcoat and dirty deadman 's shoe would be perfect for that kind of stage production cross i 'd be hard pressed to imagine cole porter working up the anger behind shabby doll in short the dark and introspective imperial bedroom wa a turning point for elvis final proof that he wa at the crest of the still expanding wave of british writer that had begun emerging in the early 80 's it wa likely the best album of 1982 a well 

i 've always thought imperial bedroom to be elvis' masterpiece and only recently listened to it again through headphone a la rem 's up i 'd never listened to it before this way and the sound and subtle nuance are even better enjoyed this way elvis' songwriting on imperial bedroom wa at it 's most crisp witty and insightful every track on here is a true jem a shining jewel well worth the money if you spring for the gold masterdisc some of these song made me cry then and still resonate now i'm glad i saw him on the imperial bedroom tour and glad i have this cd i still get a kick out of how one track bleeds into the next with assorted yelp and scream and the lyric my god at his peak elvis really wa brilliant 

hailed by columbia at the time of it release a a masterpiece and trashed by many critic expecting business a ususal from ec the attraction imperial bedroom stand a a pivotal album in ec 's career why because he created a diverse musical experience echoing everything from the tin pan alley gaints to his british music idol most notably the beatles it 's technicolor production and sweeping lyrical theme make it one of the top 100 album of all time imperial bedroom along with this year 's model armed force blood chocolate and king of america represent early costello at his best intelligent witty and musical adept at adopting a number of musical style this reissue ha stunning sound complete liner note by ec complete lyric a well a a second disc that includes the bonus track from the ryko release add to that the alternate take demo and you have a reissue worth having price a a single disc collection imperial bedroom is well worth purchasing again just to have all the extra 

the mix sound a little different for this edition which is something i have n't quite made up my mind about just yet but the real find here are the rare track found on the bonus disc which range from brilliant an early more vemonous take of you little fool a completely altered little savage to weird but enlightening the land of give and take rough early run throughs of man out of time all thing considered this is essential listening for the costellophile and a great way to kill a few hour or year 

one of the saddest look a person can make is when they are miserable and they try to come off like they 're happy goodbye cruel world with it 's happy pop production value and the desperately sad lyric not to mention how elvis costello sings them put him playing the part of the sad clown there to entertain u but the pain inside is to tough to hid that is what make this album better than what most have come to judge it a ec still doe n't like it but that make sense since he wa miserable when he made it take the opening song and the main single off the album you 're not the only flame in town the song is a duet loaded with irony right down to the fact that two men are singing it this is one song that should have been a it is on the bonus disc a lament but strangely it work in the kind of way that it 's lament is ridiculously guarded by two guy having a party with happy saxophone love field the best song on the album is so beautiful and mournful right down to the 80 's production the song give poignancy and purpose to any guarded feeling on the album other gem like home truth inch by inch i wanna be loved and joe porterhouse for the most part i wa not particularly impressed with at first those song have grown on me because there is a strong emotional expression that is coming out of them they are all song looking for human connection and the 80 's production sheen just make the the album feel that much more tragic the bonus disc is quite good i would n't say it is better than or even competes with the original album though i do think track like turning the town red and the madness cover tomorrow just another day a well a the aforementioned alternative of you 're not the only flame in town are fantastic interesting side note tomorrow is backed by madness who elvis costello wa producing at the time the demo 's of the original tune off goodbye show bare version of what were the final outcome but they are n't really that different in melody or delivery i think the main thing that kept me from liking this album immediately wa i wa expecting at least another punch the clock but it is definitely not that yet i kept coming back to it it is a very good album that should be re evaluated by any elvis costello fan or anyone interested in getting into costello 's pop album 

after hearing this it still boggles me that even elvis himself considers this his worst album from what i heard from amazon review i went in expecting to hear something that sounded more like harold faltmeyer or something with a lot of drum machine and other mid 80 's clishes and being a lover of 80 's pop i know there is such a thing a taking it too far that go for any decade but not to be a well revisionist here i have to say i wa more the pleasantly surprised this is along with the previous recordingpunch the clockone of my two favorite release by costello the 13 song presented here have a very alive tone to them topped with the same tasteful creamy 80 's soul pop jazz polish a the last album the one difference is that every song feature that sound this doe n't sound like a spiky new wave effort in the slightest that beside the point there are a handful of great song that are hugely helped by the production the only flame in town inch by inch and worthless thing are all excellent tune in and of themselves with a lot of jazzy funky groove in them that add more then a fair share of bite sour milk cow blue okay it doe have a huey lewis ish flavor but again from this view that is not a bad thing there are a number of ballad too of course great a well from the simple style of room with no number the soulful love field and my favorite i wanna be loved this is my favorite contribution of costello to the brit r b scene since his work on the previous album the delayed beat and the mildly psychedelic bit in the chorus create a unique sense of atmospherics that really make it great to hear and hear how everything come together by the end peace in our time is at least one song pretty much everyone can agree is plain great there 's no question who it 's about and there 's no irony lost when elvis declares reagen an alien in the white house considering the now deacessed ex president wa once posed on a tabloid cover with a cardboard standup of a space alien a with any elvis costello album there tend to be an awful lot of song some great some pretty good but the fact is if your good with album such a tear for fearssongs from the big chairor xtc 'soranges lemon both recording that blended contemporary rock soul pop with jazz and psychedelic influence then you will have your mind a open a possible for the music you 'll find here 

it 's commonly agreed that 'goodbye' is not one of costello 's better effort i concur but must confess enjoyment of two song that are generally cursed by ec purist 'i wanna be loved' and 'only flame in town' while not lyrically compelling i find the song musically enjoyable love the strange synth feel to 'wanna' and even the sax solo the demo version of 'only flame' on ec 's 'all this useless beauty' bonus disc is superior to the standard recording here costello originally seems to have conceived the song a a 50 style slow dance number it 's kitschy but fun 'the comedians' also recorded by the late roy orbison is about the only other cut of significant interest like 'only flame' the demo version of this song on rhino 's 'all this useless beauty' bonus disc is better than the one here 

i 've always liked this album mostly because i thought the song were great sure i wa n't crazy about the production especially the only flame in town which i thought wa embarrassing that being said the new extra disk of demo and a few leftover prove that i wa right elvis is a terrific song writer even with bad production and more often better than most others even on his worst supposed record 

punch the clock wa an attempt to court the pop chart that worked goodbye cruel world wa the hideous follow up the only decent song of note were the duet with daryl hall quot the only flame in town quot and quot i wanna be loved quot with green from scritti politti on backing vocal with maybe quot joe porterhouse quot an honorable mention it did n't become a really good song until he turned it into quot i love you when you sleep quot for tracie 's paul weller produced debut lp the ponderousness that ha marred much of costello 's material ever since start with the impostor single quot peace in our time quot and we 've been suffering the consequence ever since get everything up through punch the clock and then punch the clock 

tear off the cellophane the liner note greet you with congratulation you just bought our worst album prospect do indeed look grim and perhaps this is poor napolean 's waterloo holding his life in his hand with an artificial limp wrist it could be worse after all we 're not talking about billy joel here but after so many year of pumping out classic at such a frenetic pace he wa bound to fall off his pedestal sooner or later one listen to punch the clock it doe n't take genius to figure out a career crisis wa right around the bend personally only flame in town is a guilty pleasure of mine well not guilty it 's damn fine song like everyday i write the book it 's a pop song that make no apology for being such something you have to admire and the spare acoustic version on the bonus disc beautifully make up for any over production though a woefully barbiturate take on i wanna be loved seems to have been the the official hit the only true essential on here is love field the opening chord will never fail to stop you in your track and a demo would later prove deportee comedian are great song that never had a chance same go for alot of the material on here but hand a song over to roy orbison you might a well kiss it goodbye with the possible exception of peace in our time the rest of the album could be characterized a the sound of a man choking on his own piss vinegar slapping on slick production to disguise that fact is the perfect recipie for disaster throughout it all self loathing is all too evident in fact it 's something that would go on to characterize his next two release but where king of america took a knife stripped thing bare blood chocolate made gloriously cathartic racket everything here just turn brittle shatters to be fair this is far from the worst record ever recorded there are a lot of thing out there far more deserving of that honor that said in term of the high quality of costello 's past work this is a somewhat dismal listen for the devoted but discerning fan it might just prove too painful to witness not only doe the hero take a fall he 's the fall guy and no matter how much bonus material you tack on it wo n't put this humpty dumpty back together again 

congratulation you 've just bought our worst album this pessimistic phrase opened the liner note of a reissued copy of this cd many year ago apparently costello 's view ha n't changed too much with subsequent remasters and re release it 's no surprise especially considering that many fan and critic tend to view this album a his weakest work a well with tension arising between himself and the attraction not to mention the collapse of his first marriage goodbye cruel world is about a bleak a it get many of the lyric do n't even try to hide this and elvis readily admits that he took a decent bunch of song and ended up completely missing the mark with them it 's a bleak picture but i personally believe that costello 's being a bit hard on himself this album certainly is n't his finest work but it ha enough gem to warrant a few spin and even ownership for the dedicated fan the opener the only flame in town complete with a guest appearance daryl hall is coated with 80 's cheese but it 's so catchy and fun that i do n't even care if you can get past the dated production it 's a solid track that doe exactly what it 's supposed to do using the same producer who had worked on punch the clock costello 's song feel a bit too slick this time around and many of them lack the personal grittiness stylistically that the lyric need to really be effective the deportee club sour milk cow blue and i wanna be loved are n't bad song by any mean but the overdone production robs them of the intimacy and storytelling finesse that they appear to be going for granted i wanna be loved is a cover but it still could have used a bit more raw intensity in the end that seems to be the album 's biggest flaw a batch of personal and dark song that feel too polished and overdone to really hit their mark however there 's still plenty to like here home truth is a great number about falling out of love with someone you 've admired for year and there 's little doubt that elvis' divorce played a large part in the song 's influence inch by inch and worthless thing are both solid pop number that have enough hook to keep you coming back for more while room with no number is more reminiscent of costello 's earlier work on trust and armed force peace in our time is a decent closer to the record and love field feature some nice synth effect that manage to hold the song together in an interesting structure the real gem here is the comedian a song that roy orbison would later make famous thanks to his impeccable interpretation it 's a bright spot and a tune worth pursuing the biggest problem with goodbye cruel world is that it just feel unfocused is it a pop record a soul record or something else it 's difficult to tell and ultimately i think that 's what hurt it the most the attraction feel underused and simply play their part without much distinction or vigor the problem in costello 's personal life obviously took their toll but i'm happy to say this record is n't a bad a many will lead you to believe i wa pleasantly surprised upon hearing it to find that i liked a majority of the song and over the year it 's grown on me even more i 'll even go so far a to say that i do n't even think it 's his weakest album and i'm glad to see that there are other fan out there who appreciate this album for what it is it 's not his best work but even subpar elvis costello is better than what many artist can put out on their best day 

i came to work with the intention of writing an embittered and overly angry review regarding the negative review but i 've since calmed down a lot of people do n't like this album i can sort of understand why and then again i really ca n't the production personally it 's fine it actually sound like the first four they might be giant record which is not coincidental six year later the same production team would produce the massively popular flood album excluding the intentionally overproduced only flame in town and i wanna be loved speaking of the only flame in town nice a an eighty pop confection but i 'll only listen to it when no one else is around or while wearing headphone the sax intro doe permanently date the song unfortunately not to mention a quasi duet with freakin' daryl hall the other super produced song i wanna be loved is actually quite excellent your liking of it will be based on how much you like synth noise and drum machine beat the rest sound like a lesser armed force frankly it 's not a good a most of his other album but it 's not bad at all it 's sequenced nicely and after the opening track i never feel like skipping any song and the song are amazing home truth the comedian worthless thing love field the great unknown all rather excellent i'm sure i'm not the only one who think so highly of this much maligned album but i certainly feel like it please if you such people exist write a positive review on here so i wo n't feel so lonely even costello hate this record which made me want to hate it so bad but i just ca n't 

i 'll admit it i recall that the first time i heard goodbye cruel world i wa le than impressed in fact i wa of the mind that it wa the album where i wondered if elvis' reach had finally exceeded his grasp even elvis himself conceded the point on the ryko reissue with the now infamous you 've purchased our worst album comment but time ha given goodbye cruel world a finer burnish the tug of war going on between elvis himself his band and producer langer and winstanley took some darn good song and date stamped them pretty solidly that doe n't mean the song are any le stellar in fact two of his strongest song ever are here the anthem peace in our time and the comedian although there 's no way to escape the fact that roy orbison 's eventual version completely trump costello 's along with shipbuilding peace in our time join the great political song that ec ha written and is even timely now there 's a man going round taking name no matter who you claim to be a innocent a baby a mad dog with rabies you 're still part of some conspiracy so why is this such a put upon cd the unfortunate answer lie on the bonus disc from the 2004 rhino double cd which once again took a three star album and pump it up an additional star listen to the confusion frustration and hurt in some of those demo then compare them to the slickly produced final version even the alternate take of only flame in town took on a totally different personality sounding more like a demo for ray charles than the peppy brush with the top 40 that featured daryl hall if you left this in the memory dustbin maybe it 's time you once again said hello to goodbye cruel world but i still recommend the rhino version because a time ha shown elvis at his alleged worst can trounce many artist at their best 

the mistake wa working with the attraction on this one that and a very unhappy declan macmanus although goodbye cruel world ha become notorious for having congradulations you 've bought our worst album in the cd liner note nobody knew when it first came out that it would be one of ec 's weaker album the poppy single track you 're not the only flame in town promised so much more there are a couple of gem here and buried somewhere under langer winstanley 's production is a good solid album by ec ta the reissue is much much better than the original release why because the second disc ha 11 of the track from the original album in demo form do n't sell those old ryko demon cd yet it also ha the previously released bonus track from the original release with the curious exception of deportee a re recording of the track the deportee club with a new melody i'm at a loss a to why it wa n't included here a it 's a valid attempt to find new life in an old song the liner note make this almost worth the price of admission we get an extensive booklet with more info than in the previous one plus lyric to all the song including demo lyric that might be different from the final release either way this along with it companion album almost blue and kojak variety also re relased at the same time form part of a trio of unloved unwanted ec album embrace them and decide for yourself 

goodbye cruel world is routinely dismissed a the worst release from elvis costello even by the artist himself i'm not sure if i would rank it at the very bottom but it definitely is weaker than most of his catalog although i 'd argue that even mediocre costello is still pretty damned good indeed there 's much quality work here unfortunately a others have noted the production by clive langer and alan winstanley is simply terrible displaying the worst kind of 80 excess langer and winstanley had produced costello 's prior record punch the clock which yielded one of costello 's biggest u s hit everyday i write the book their production more or le work there previously they were best known for producing most of madness' hit and they brought some of that everything but the kitchen sink ska approach here the only flame in town is a lovely song buried under layer of tacky 80 production a squealing sax overly loud vocal and a scarily aggressive xylophone it wa the only `hit' in america peaking at 44 on the rock chart home truth is a gorgeous song but a with so much of the material it needed to be quieter it would be stunning with an acapella opener or even a subdued piano accompaniment room with no number is one of the worst victim of overproduction with an extended musical break section so frantic it could play in a looney tune a highlight is i wanna be loved by obscure 70 r b group teacher 's edition which served a the second single peaking at 25 in the uk costello 's vocal on this song are beautiful and emotional although even this song get marred by a screeching sax solo that would sound more at home on a whitney houston singe i also like the lead single peace in our time it only peaked at 48 in the uk it doe n't have a particularly memorable chorus but it is relatively understated compared to the rest of the record a always costello 's lyric are clever and insightful the playful worthless thing for example crackle with irony oh i wish you could see quite how much you could mean to me you worthless thing really there is n't a bad song here just song that could be improved with better production although the egregiously loud the deportee club would probably make my list of his weakest song sadly a stripped down version known a deportee is absolutely gorgeous the reissue by ryodisc and rhino really illustrate that point via some rather stunning live version and demo of these song just check out the live version of the only flame in town for evidence fortunately for his next record costello co produced with t bone burnett and they turned out what i consider his best record king of america wherever you rank goodbye cruel world it 's still a worthwhile effort that offer some enjoyment 

considering what a critic darlingking of americawound up becomming elvis costello rebounded with the attraction and original producer nick lowe for this album this is not only very different from the previous album but very different from the last two album with the attraction before this the best i can describe it is a something of a mid 80 's updated mixture of the jerky new wave rhythm of his late 70 's album and some of the more carefully crafted pop rock styled music of the early 80 's taken individually the song on this album are all highly melodic tend towards the upbeat musically and have particularly biting and scatching lyric even by elvis costello standard one of the great thing about costello is his ability to express emotion such a betrayal irritation and even anger without resorting to childish simplification or witless cynicism much a john lennon before him perhaps even to a further degree costello can take a negative subject and intellectualize it to such an extent it pretty much becomes a more positive thought or at least a more setttled one anyway uncomplicated open the album with a harsh agitated melody and guitar sound whereas i hope your happy now home is anywhere you hang your head and even the conveniently possitioned i want you all posse the rolling drum jangly guitar and melodicism of mid 60 's beatles part of the classic attraction sound a it wa later in the album you hear more elaboratly constructed song such a the darkly textured battered old bird and poor napoleon named after the alias he 'd taken for this album release a with the previous album even though this is more based in modern pop music than that had been this album is still somewhat atypical of much of pop music of it 's time because it in many way anticipates the decade to come this album hold up a lot better in today environment where with the exception of maybe rem at this point this may have seemed a bit different from most of what wa commercially popular it wind up a solid elvis costello attraction album regardless and is one of the finer release from any period 

i will defer to all the laudatory comment listed here i had one observation however regarding this new version by rhino v the previous also excellent version by rykodisc the final track on the ryko cd wa a town called big nothing really big nothing a wonderful 5 minute little gem originally writen for a alex cox film that featured costello 's father on trumpet however it is not included on the new rhino cd this is a curious and unfortunate omission so fyi to all who are considering replacing the ryko 's perhaps rhino will include it on one of the future costello release update the track never made it to any of the rhino release it now only appears on the single volume 3 set 

'blood and chocolate' is one of those release that stand up from start to finish but doe n't contain any immediately famous song or any real costello standard like 'my aim is true' ha 'alison' and 'spike' ha 'veronica' but ha some of his strongest writing and best material this album is definitely a quot return to root quot album in a way after releasing quot trust quot quot punch the clock quot and quot goodbye cruel world quot all of which seemed kinda polished and quot contemporary quot meaning very 80 sounding this is elvis with his fender telecaster and the attraction playing bitter angry rock and roll the highlight of this set are the creepy and almost stalkerish 'i want you' the thrasing 'uncomplicated' he doe the one chord thing better than the velvet underground or the stooge ever did and the carnivalesque 'tokyo storm warning' 'poor napoleon' is a hidden gem and so is the rocking final song 'next time around' 'north' is how elvis reacted to heartbreak and torment in 2003 and 'blood amp chocolate' is the elvis of 1986 it 's amazing how the same man can relate to similar event with such different work 'blood amp chocolate' is a highlight of elvis in the 80 along with 'get happy ' 

a solidly enjoyable return to rock after several year of weirdness it kind of reminds me of this year 's model four piece rock with a funk edge and lovably cheesy keyboard and it 's good uncomplicated i hope you 're happy now honey are you straight or are you blind the jangly next time around the difference is there are a few longer track that are great too the ominous rumble of tokyo storm warning the torch ballad of sort home is anywhere you hang your head the possessive i want you a slow creepy build up of a song and costello 's undeniable songwriting skill make even weak song like blue chair stupid harpsichord and the rather unspectacular crime of paris other than i want you none of these song are exactly classic but it 's an all around good album though the fourth extended track battered old bird is a bit much and the spaced out intro to poor napoleon annoys me still a very respectable album one of costello 's best 

blood chocolate knife fight the easter bunny indeed my mother warned me about mr costello she said his music would lead me to act of depravity so i consulted our pastor and he more or le said the same thing but i bought the album anyway i bought it and i listened i listened and i listened then i took my sweater to the goodwill and got myself shabby but cooler looking clothes i'm ruined 

originally released in 1986 this is generally known a the elvis costello album that returned to the sound of his excellent 1978 80 era recording with the attraction listening to the cd is somewhat different from the lp in many case artist and perhaps even record company sequenced lp 's to deliver a certain impact in the case of 'blood and chocolate' the first side track 1 5 wa the edgier of the two all you need to do is listen to the first song quot uncomplicated quot and you get the message that is followed up by one of my favorite ec song quot i hope your happy now quot which i would rate a one elvis' best this song is great because the lyric and melody recall the heyday of 'armed forces' but also show a certain evolution of both elvis and the attraction next is quot tokyo storm warning quot which for some reason wa marketed at the time a the main single off of the album ending the first side wa the great quot i want you quot some major emotion on this one even after multiple listens it never get old from that point on the rest of the track are on the lackluster side most are solid if not spectacular although the second to last track quot poor napoleon quot kind of drag thing down for this reason i would rate the album at four star put into the context of the time 'blood and chocolate' wa a refreshing listen after the puzzling post 1981 output that wa 'almost blue' 'imperial bedroom' 'punch the clock' 'goodbye cruel world' and the attraction le except for one song 'king of america' the second disc also contains some excellent material such a quot seven day weekend quot quot baby 's got a brand new hairdo quot another song that recall earlier recording and the previously unreleased quot leave my kitten alone quot 

quite i want you is just incredible it just sends chill down your spine every time of course we ca n't ignore the greatness of battered old bird tokyo storm warning or crime of paris either and then there 's honey are you straight or are you blind probably his single most straight ahead rock song greatness abounds even amongst the bonus track despite costello 's le than enthusiastic summings up of them in the liner note seven day weekend and baby 's got a brand new hairdo are nice rockin' little number i even like the goofy spaghetti westernness of a town called big nothing there are a few track that are n't altogether awe inspiring but they are the minority most of this album rock and i would like to point out my copy came with a cool seventy minute promotional interview cd sweet 

i love e c i love the attraction i love nick lowe so i wa so excited when this came out a it wa so hot on the heel of king of america i wa actually disappointed with king of america it ha improved with age like a fine wine so i saw this a an obvious attempt to return to the fantastic form of his pre punch the clock day a i listened i wa so let down i thought this album wa a noisy mess with weak song a time passed i thought perhaps i 'd been subverted by my own high expectation so i bought the ryko reissue and gave it another chance well my opinion ha n't changed it 's still a struggle to listen to this album possibly even more so a my ear have aged and the mid range heavy production grate more than ever i hate to say it but i 'd rather listen to goodbye cruel world than this album 

this along with imperial bedroom is my favorite costello macmanus album i actually prefer his real name declan macmanus i have loved the fact that costello ha changed over the year trying ever musical style known to man writing probably around 1000 song or so and ha never really made a godawful album goodbye cruel world generally considered his worst album ha some good tune on it declan released 2 album in 1986 king of america another masterpiece and this one this one is much rawer and more powerful the opener uncomplicated is superb the next one i hope you 're happy now is cool too but the 2 masterpiece are tokyo storm warning a breathless amazing piece of wordplay and music and the song i want you is one of the best song about love and anger i 've ever heard costello ha been really amazing throughout his career he can still turn the anger on but it never defined him a an artist or a a human being he 's not stuck in arrested development like some rocker can be he continues to grow a an artist he may have started out a a punk but he is n't a punk and honestly never really wa he ha a ton of depth that really come out in his music declan rule for the record the name napoleon dynamite wa a pseudonym used by declan on this album it wa appropriated for the movie year later even though the director claimed he never heard of this album which i doubt personally 

back in the early 80 's a an unsuspecting teenager who 'd heard opportunity off of get happy on our then excellent aaa station k 99 r i p i ordered get happy and armed force when my sister and i convinced our parent to join the columbia record club basically a rip off but oh the music i discovered from that point forward i wa an e c fan cue forward a few year a a junior in college and this album is released to little press or fanfare but i think what the heck i 'll check it out at first i wa disappointed not quite a hooky or instantly gettable a some of costello 's older material it 's one that over time ha grown to be my favorite while musically it may be le accessible at first lyrically it is costello with his finest most caustic biting wit expressed in scream and shout that make you feel like your in the recording booth with him blue chair is probably one of my favorite costello song ever and that 's amongst many others i could throw in that once this album grab you you will feel emotionally wrung out every time you listen to it use headphone for full effect 

welcome to the place where they take your spine turn it into soap flake costello ha always been angry he built his reputation on it but on blood chocolate all kid glove are off those great pop hook bitter turn of phrase are there but here he deliberately keep thing a ugly a possible playing almost in mockery of stuff like oliver 's army it 's the sonic equivalent of burning oneself in effigy smothered in decidedly claustrophobic production the whole album sound like a bar brawl in a broom closet uncomplicated clang in like a ringside bell one immediately get the sense that everyone 's playing in the dark pissed a hell determined to beat any semblance of melody into a pulp steve neive hit the wulitzer like a drunken carny pete thomas seems to be pounding on the decapitated head of those he hate a if in spiteful opposition bruce thomas play a if he 's creeping up to push the shiv in a for costello he gleefully life up to the self deprecating nickname little hand of concrete spitting out his lyric a if he could n't stand the taste of them throughout they seem intent on flogging the same dead horse especially the like of tokyo storm warning honey are you straight or are you blind elsewhere the atmosphere could only be described a perverse a major highlight is i want you easily one of the creepiest most powerful song he 's ever recorded i suppose the whole album could be summed up with the line the truth ca n't hurt you it 's just like the dark it scare you witless but in time you see thing clear stark the most epic number ha to be battered old bird despite it 's maudlin tone never ha the boardinghouse come so close to bedlam the character are more like inmate from an asylum than tenant he 's never recorded anything like it a for the bonus disc 3 track stand out among the debris costello 's fondness for burt bacharach is obvious in you 'll forgive her anything a vastly superior take than the one found on the ryko reissue there 's also a furious assault on leave my kitten alone that put the kojak variety version to shame lastly a lost classic can be found in new rhythm method in the liner note costello confesses that b c sound like a bitter 33 year old divorcee 's answer to this year's model it also could be considered the sound of costello not only breaking up with the attraction but with himself a well one listen to later album like brutal youth useless beauty it 's evident they were far more than a mere backing band this album is definitely not for beginner or fickle fan who could never get beyond the first three album it 's his tonight's the night or song of love hate separating the connoisseur from the tourist 

this is a good album my favorite song are i want you battered old bird tokyo storm warning blue chair and i hope you 're happy now it 's one of my favorite elvis costello album i 've seen him in concert twice and both time were amazing bye 

elvis costello 's second record of 1986 is a stark departure from the first king of america blood chocolate is a rollicking and ferocious effort in the vain of his earlier album like this year 's model and armed force for anyone who wondered if costello had lost the edge and spunk that made him famous to begin with one listen to this record left little doubt that he had n't completely disposed of the anger and energy that made his first album so compelling the attraction make a welcome return and tension in the group were at an all time high in fact this would be the last album that costello would record with them for nearly a decade the unrest is evident in the song which are loud and have a live on the floor feeling there 's little polish or double tracking just pure rock n' roll at it finest i hope you 're happy now honey are you straight or are you blind crime of paris and blue chair are all great rock song that perfectly capture the sound that elvis had perfected so well the six minute tokyo storm warning tell the story of a dazed and overwhelming trip through the famous city and it chug along at a relentless pace that never let up uncomplicated is a nice way to open the album and it contains the memorable line when you 're over me there 's no one above you classic many of the song title reveal the hurt and anger that still seemed to be boiling over from the last couple of year home is anywhere you hang your head and battered old bird are both crushing and beautiful piece of work that are a haunting and unsettling a they are catchy and exciting poor napoleon feature a neat arrangement while next time round close the record with a more optimistic if somewhat pensive viewpoint however it 's i want you that brings the whole package together it 's absolutely devastating in it simplicity and bite a true work of genius that still remains one of his most beloved and acclaimed composition it start off with gentle vocal and guitar before gradually building and then fading out once again it 's epic and deserves to be heard even though it may take a few listens to fully grab you and sink in blood chocolate is one of the angriest and loudest album costello 's ever made yet it 's just honest and tender enough to keep it humanity the lyric in particular are rough and full of venom almost a if elvis turn the gun on everyone he know before eventually turning it on himself no one is safe and it only add to the passion of this recording 1986 seemed to be the year when every costello fan got their wish they got the quiet and experimental side of ec while also getting a stripped down rocker full of angst and energy for costello to release not one but two classic in the same year is a true testament to his vision and talent a an artist this is a must have for rock fan and elvis completists alike 

i like a good number of ec song and uncomplicated to me is grammy level with plenty to spare a marriage of music and lyric to be envied by dylan himself the pre skyline dylan too the title tune of sort it simply say that the bitter meet the sweet a blood and chocolate leave the same chromatic trace a perfectly captured performance with the imposter to assure its' drive and bottom and the star well up in the mix the next most accessible and memorable track is tokyo storm warning another thematic highlight but to this reviewer once you realize there wa some unconscious borrowing of the rolli8ng stones' 19th nevous breakdown it stutter just a bit the rest of the set is for serious costello ites i always find his writing difficult to decipher his singing loud but unclear also never surprising always in that same box of key and pitch it 's not a particularly artful style a the note seem to come from the back of his throat tongue extended something like the way bruce springsteen and joe cocker do it a deep fan will say whatever it work 

after a couple of year of more subtle work elvis costello reteamed with the attraction for a fierce angry release blood amp chocolate with producer extrodinaire nick lowe again manning the board mr costello spewed forth venomous song based around his recent divorce quot i hope you 're happy now quot sum up the overall tone of the album quot tokyo storm warning quot is a blistering extended jam while quot honey are you straight or are you blind quot is a frenetically paced rocker that harkened back to the band 's late 70 's sound quot i want you quot is a song that conveys mr costello 's longing for his lost relationship despite the overall angry tone the album close with quot next time round quot which show a more wizened man that will learn from his mistake 

this album romp around and bang key but is most notable fori want youa most stark tightjaw tingling song young man i do believe you 're dying 

after the extreme of king of america punch the clock and imperial bedroom elvis costello made what he probably suspected people would conceive of a a typical elvis costello and the attraction album nick lowe came back on board and they threw subtlety to the wind for blood and chocolate elvis costello 's angriest album since this year 's model fueled by his recent divorce and a few rancorous hollywood romantic disaster elvis himself described the inspiration for most of this material a messing up my life so i could write stupid little song about it i hope you 're satisfied with what you 've done that opening line set the tone of uncomplicated and the oncoming barrage for the album ec unleashes wave after wave of vitriol backed by the attractions' and lowe 's artful distortion the distorted sound match the emotional content of many of the song and one of elvis' most brilliant performance of all time is here on i want you he drag you into a hellish confrontation that move at half the album 's general pace with more than a passing nod to john lennon and the beatles' song of the same name elvis vent with derisive passion till the sound slowly drop away and with little more than the sound of him deeply breathing the title over and over the song come to a close i want you is reason enough to have blood and chocolate but if you need more there 's the bizarre dylanesque travelogue of tokyo storm warning next to hurry down doomsday the bug are taking over from mighty like a rose it 's one of ec 's weirdest song and contains the wonderful line about the japanese jesus robot telling teenage fortune perhaps it 's in the fact that the recording of blood and chocolate wa done a quickly a possible with a few take a necessary but for the most part this wa elvis most relentless cd since this year 's model with bonus disc just do n't let that stop you from getting this cd it 's a boxful of some very angry candy 

a an ec fan this is possibly the most punk album by the punk new wave pioneer true it came out in 1986 but it 's a raw live in the studio mostly rock band playing song it work better than he think it doe hard driving desperate rock and roll from ec and the attraction steve nieve 's organ punctuates madly and cascade it 's way over bruce thomas 's bass line creating a melody like a disastrous waterfall that pours over pete thomas 's rock solid drumming the result is a discordant spartan proceeding that ha some of ec 's best song and the attractions' best playing word well here 's a boy if ever there wa who 's gonna do great thing i guess that 's what they all say and that 's how the trouble begin i 've seen them rise and fall and through their big deal and small and he better have a dream that go beyond 4 wall lyric brilliance vocal emotiveness unrivaled by a damn good soul singer and awesome musicality buy it or die trying fantastic album and the bonus cd well great stuff alternate take of album track that make me trust ec 's judgement and some demo and some b side well a non fan doe n't need any of it but for someone who ha followed a career it 's invaluable luckily rhino is not charging for the second cd buy them realize them enjoy them this is songwriting at it 's best trust me this is worth your time 

one of costello 's most riveting album blood and chocolate is n't quite a consistent a earlier outing but is nevertheless one of his most powerful one could argue that emotionally it 's one of his most personal album a well this is about a raw a ec get the remastered sound is great and the booklet very informative much more so than the version released with the ryko reissue is it worth picking up again frankly yes because of the second disc while ec ha relocated the bonus track to the second disc he 's also added a handful of previously unreleased or rare track that make this an essential edition to any fan the attraction have never sounded this brutal before the song are direct and played without the flourish that one had come to expect from the band a quick note for fan the initial batch release ha the disc mislabeled the quot bonus quot disc is actually b amp c this is also the case with brutal youth another underrated album in ec 's catalog and yes essential 

man this is one great blue guitar album it may be listed under albert collins but this is a true collaboration robert cray really shine here and is much bluesier then you will find him on his own album all three share in the vocal duty and the guitar solo no one play over each other it 's a great collaboration that result in a great album just listen to the first cut and you will get a good taste of what is in store buy it and enjoy 

it 's nothing short of awesome to hear these three guitar great come together albert collins wa one of the best blue guitarist in the world any recording which feature him is going to be worthwhile robert cray is very good too and ha a wonderful voice johnny copeland contributes some nice vocal and guitar lick but i'm not a familiar with him a i am albert and robert there are only two downside to this wonderful cd first the sound quality is n't a good a it could be it definitely sound it age i know that alligator is not a huge record label but it would be nice if they could remaster and rerelease some of their title such a this one second drawback is that the album is too short it 's so good that you do n't want it to end it 's not much longer than half an hour but it is good stuff if you like guitar based blue buy this cd 

albert collins and johnny copeland were two of the pioneer of texas blue and major influence to the late stevie ray vaughan these two guy work their magic on this cd and bring on a young bluesman named robert cray these guy just seem to have fun with this cd never trying to outdo each other great riff in the leadoff track quot t bone shuffle quot harmonica on quot bring your fine self home quot lyric in quot black cat bone quot hear johnny copeland yelling quot hey albert quot and the last track quot blackjack quot where each doe a tremendous guitar solo cray of course is now a major talent in his own right and johnny copeland life on in a way in his daughter shemekia copeland 's music but here is a playful low key yet powerful piece of work from some of the master of electric blue highly recommended for serious blue fan 

showdown is one of the top two or three blue guitar collaboration of all time albert collins johnny copeland and robert cray all on one record unbelievable but that 's what happened and the result wa magic all three get a chance to show their chop and all three were on top of their blue guitar game recording this record the energy skill and unbridled joy at performing with talented musician always brings the best out from other talented musician every cut is excellent it 's a shame that showdown could have been repeated more often than twice both collins and copeland are gone leaving cray to find other blue great to jam with but we will always have showdown to remember when

but quite something else to sing the praise of a curb release and they are up to their usual with this one providing just 10 track and with the exception of a brief seven line on the reverse no liner note or discography of the content at least all ten track were legitimate hit they do n't always do that with their release and they expand a bit on the claim to being his greatest hit by saying they span the year 1979 1981 even there they 're a bit off a both a country boy can survive 2 and the american dream 5 peaked in 1982 the latter some four month after honky tonkin' hit 1 and is omitted here still three of the hit here were 1 texas woman dixie on my mind and all my rowdy friend have settled down which take in a third of his nine 1 's among the 98 hit single he registered from 1964 to 1995 not a bad little compilation but for a few dollar more you can get those same song along with at least 18 others a well a some interesting background note these 10 to 12 track release are no longer acceptable 

hank williams jr ha to be one of my very favorite country star all of his song are always excellent this cd includes all of his best track my very favorite is his '79 number 1 family tradition 

i bought this on record when it first came out in 1982 the only hank record i had wa the new south which i hated but over time it ha gotten better all the song on this album were hit so i knew the song already when i bought this then after this i started buying everything he started coming out with although i have not bought anything new by him since wild streak this is a very good cd and what a greatest hit should be starting off with family tradition and whiskey bent and hell bound my two least favorite song on here i love every other song and the original a country boy can survive is my favorite hank song and just a meaningful now a it wa 30 plus year ago this is country music with an attitude sung by a person that if you dont want to know what he think then dont ask a singer who should be proud of what he ha done and the name he ha made on his own 

even though trendy folk like gretchen wilson and big and rich are abusively gripping to his coattail you have to remember that hank jr wa n't always the popular kid on the nashville schoolbus it took them year to recognize him a a true performer who stood on his own perhaps it wa having to deal with the shadow of his father or just that nashville did n't want him to be a popular act bocephus never received his due until he wa well into his career hank jr remedied the problem of being the outcast in nashville by doing what so many artist ca n't do be himself sure he 's loud a little too honest and just a flat out hellraiser but that 's what folk like to hear that 's what ha staying power this disc which feature bocephus' biggest hit from the late 70 's early 80 's is loaded with enough attitude to shake up even the biggest poser in nashville thing open up with family tradition the song that is a legend unto itself in bar and honky tonks across the usa next we have whiskey bent and hell bound woman i 've never had and seven more instantly recognizable hit my personal favorite include texas woman maybe 'cause i married one and dixie on my mind the biggest song on this disc ha to be a country boy can survive it 's the song that ha spawned countless argument over what would happen if the world fell apart tomorrow it ha empowered the good bad and ugly of the rural world it make city boy quiver in their metrosexual underpants in short it is one of the most popular song ever put out there it 's influence is still felt today in act like montgomery gentry and even kid rock in closing buy this disc if you want real rebel country folk who like music by artist like waylon jennings will probably like this also youngster who enjoy kid rock need to check this out since without hank kid rock might have turned out to be another vanilla ice give bocephus his due he 's an integral part of the country southern rock genre 

hank williams jr 's greatest hit 1982 is the one album no fan of bocephus should be without this is the best music from hank 's glory day in the late 1970s and early 1980s the album ha been certified quintuple platinum and one can only imagine how many time whiskey bent and hell bound ha been played on juke box in the bar of america i 've contributed to that number a few time myself getting drunk is a major theme here and hank mention jim beam the kentucky bourbon in about half of the song his dad hank williams sr is mentioned quite a bit here too stepping out from beneath his dad 's huge shadow had been something of an obsession for hank jr for most of his life he wa only three when his famous father died in the back seat of a cadillac on the way to a new year 's day show in 1953 after being taught to play guitar by johnny cash and piano by jerry lee lewis his mother audrey williams took him on the road to sing his dad 's song after a near fatal fall from the side of a montana mountain while climbing in 1975 and two year of recovery time he and friend mentor waylon jennings produced an album of hank jr 's song called the new south done his own way the album wa a real turning point for hank hank williams jr 's greatest hit includes one of his dad 's song kaw liga and hank jr give it the full on southern rock treatment waylon sings backing vocal on texas woman hank 's celebration of the lone star beauty a country boy can survive is a 4 wheelin' huntin'and fishin' outdoors partyin' anthem for country boy and girl everywhere old habit is a slow sad song about being left behind and dixie on my mind is a southern rocker about being stuck in the big apple and wanting to get back home woman i 've never had is a dixieland music celebration of all thing hank and all my rowdy friend have settled down is a famous friend name dropping lament of the no one left to party with blue the autobiographical family tradition is hank williams jr 's signature song so do n't ask me hank why do you drink why do you roll smoke why must you live out the song that you wrote stop and think it overtry and put yourself in my unique positionif i get stoned and sing all night longit 's a family tradition 

how the son of a country star could claim to have hillbilly credibility is frankly beyond me but there he is for the most part hank sound like just what he really is a poseur whining about the trail of being a rich rock star he doe hit the mark on occasion a with `the american dream' and `a country boy can survive' but mostly this is just fluff 

this is perhaps some of his best work i have enjoyed the evolving style that jr ha continued to develop throughout his musical career 

`joan baez vol 1 and vol 2' are incredibly evocative of a particular time and zeitgeist in american popular music listening to them now it is humbling to think that it ha been over forty year since i first bought these vanguard album which according to a `time' magazine article of the time turned the very small folkie recording company into a pretty important recording company just in time to be in on the 1960 's music explosion the buzz at the same time wa that in spite of her success vanguard could not convince baez to do more than one album a year she and the folk music scene in the early sixty were still a major topic of conversation in sophisticated circle one of the most prescient statement i ever heard wa from my german professor 's opinion expressed in the fall of 1963 that the american folk music interest would not survive the arrival of the beatles in most way i think he wa very very right in that baez' version of old english ballad and material from folkways did not survive the british invasion instead this musical revolution plus the target rich landscape of the mid 1960s spawned a great generation built on the legacy of woody guthrie instead of `childe 's ballad this wa lead by bob dylan phil ochs the much missed phil ochs tom paxton richard farina and many more m baez jumped on this bandwagon primarily a a consort to mr dylan but not until she left u with these really remarkable rendition of historical music contrary to what you may believe from the title these two album were first published about a year apart with title even more modest that m baez' contemporary barbara streisand a i am not an expert on old english folk music my best comparison for m baez performance are in fact m streisand on the one hand and the english jacqui mcshee female vocalist for the pentangle and the john renbourn group on the other while m mcshee doe a great job when she doe the same material i think miss joan set the standard with her crystal clear vibrato free voice baez also doe better on this material than her principle competitor on elektra judy collins on the other hand when i compare joan to barbra i feel there is just something missing in joanie 's interpretation aside from having a great set of pipe this of course is one of streisand 's strong point a she give dramatically different take on some old chestnut such a `happy day are here again' and yet m baez justly famous crystal clear voice give performance of these song you will find nowhere else it is highly unlikely that the contemporary music audience will again support an act doing this material and i do n't think it 's because of a `been there done that' reaction so dig into these old album with both arm and enjoy them for they are both great and an important part of popular music history 

i do n't suppose there are too many folk enthusiast out there who are also audiophiles besides myself of course but this cd is a godsend to both camp it 's been too long since baez 's much lauded quot achingly pure soprano quot sounded this good the song themselves need no introduction this is a traditional a traditional music get and baez give it a very traditional treatment accompanying her singing only with a guitar or banjo or not at all if this spare production doe n't suggest itself for digital remastering the result are stunning all the same every note of the fast and intricate guitar fill in on quot lonesome road quot and the banjo solo on quot pal of mine quot among others ring with a clarity that wa n't technologically feasible when this album wa originally released in 1961 and which wa n't attempted on any previous reissue baez 's vocal performance if possible sound even better a well the three quot bonus quot track while unnecessary given the improved quality of the more familiar song are nonetheless welcome the gorgeous quot i once loved a boy quot is a particularly pleasant surprise but all three fit in well alongside the bulk of the album an unusual case of bonus track improving a familiar album rather than hindering it even if you think you know these song by heart this collection is essential to any fan of '60s folk music in it purest form even vinyl purist owe it to themselves to hear this 

m baez ha a pure crystalline voice that is an instrument unto itself you will know what i mean when you hear her sing waggoner 's lad without accompaniment this is quickly followed up by some achingly beautiful folk song such a the tree they do grow high the lily of the west and silkie wham bam before you know it you are hooked this extraordinary cd originally ended with plaisir d'amour which is a beautiful love song and sung by m baez one that will not be easily forgotten this released which ha remastered the original recording now ha three additional bonus track that are pleasant addition to an already marvelous musical experience this is simply a wonderful cd and if you are not already a fan of m baez it will quickly make you into one she is undoubtedly a national treasure 

and just a essential i believe that joan 's first three album were her most astoundingly successful of her entire career and many of the song she sang on this album were sung by others a well peter paul mary mary hopkin to name a few highly recommended 

this is my 2nd time out for baez 's second album i'm a big fan of the first album and of her contemporary carolyn hester but i 'd forgotten that i traded this one in year ago the arrangement are dull and pedestrian and it 's amazing how irritating joan 's voice can be when the material or it just the arrangement are so weak i'm a folk fan dylan carolyn hester peter paul and mary the weaver journeyman roger mcguinn fairport kingston trio and ian and sylvia are special favorite so it 's not so easy for me to dislike a straight ahead folk album like this one however i found joan baez 's 2nd album a very difficult listen the 2nd time out it 's back in the trade in pile for the 2nd time 

listening to in concert today i am struck by joan baez 's keen ability to interpret these beautiful folk song she truly wa in her element more than that achingly pure soprano she wa able to convey the drama the pathos and the sheer longing of the lyric just listening to her performance of matty grove i can get so drawn in to the song that i can visualize the proceeding she wa also a very accomplished and talented guitar player joan baez had a tremendous impact on american popular music and you can hear why in this recording 

this is a live concert recording so be prepared for clapping and an enthusiastic reception by the concert crowd it is quintessential early joan baez simply strumming her guitar and singing folk song that she love it wa recorded at various concert during her tour in august 1962 and october november 1963 her clear sweet soprano is exquisite and her choice of these thirteen folk song should satisfy the most ardent purist truly hers is the voice of an angel for those of u who grew up with the music of joan baez this recording is a glorious trip down memory lane the quality of this cd is what one may expect from such an early live recording a it suffers from an occasional lack of clarity and from a slight variance in volume from song to song still this is a cd that all devoted fan of m baez will want to include in their collection if only for her wistful rendition of what have they done to the rain 

joan baez' third album in concert part one remains the quintessential album of the 1960s folk revival and stand on it own a a remarkably beautiful piece of music although recorded in the 1960s it atmosphere is surprisingly dark and haunting throughout and satnds up very well to almost a half century of time baez' beautiful voice wa at no point so intense or powerful a it wa on in concert part one on some song such a gospel ship and kumbaya she is truly tearful yet sings with a beauty so genuine it will live in your mind forever after one or two listens although her version of matty grove doe not quite match the astonishing rendition fromliege and lief it still tell a brutal tale malvina reynolds' what have they done to the rain on the other hand wa baez' first move into the realm of the protest song yet is remarkably touching and intimate with it simple yet powerful metaphor of the grass dying from poisoned rainwater the dark despairing imagery is blackest on house carpenter 's daughter geordie and copper kettle which are further proof of the amazingly touching yet beautiful imagery of traditional folk that proved the richest of vein for such artist a fairport convention and steeleye span during the 1970s all joan baez album up to the oft misunderstoodbaptismare worth owning but there is little doubt in concert part one is the finest hour of her career anyone interested in traditional folk song should own this album 

i love hearing joan in concert what a voice really great song sung here and unlike modern day live album there isnt a lot of repeat so you 're not buying joan baez vol 1 or vol 2 again just live not like that at all 

oh this is so beautiful the song the respectful audience and her pristine evocative voice there 's an almost gospel like quality in the song kumbaya gospel ship and the eery lady mary while the portuguese song at eacute amanha is an uptempo singalong ditty and pretty boy floyd soar above the cloud this is pure poetry infused with a spirit of transcendence a very sensitive and moving listening experience 

time wa when this document of a 1962 baez concert wa released that a musician could go on stage armed with only a guitar and voice sing song that required listening and involvement by the audience and be successful while that time may seem long ago and far away now this first volume of quot joan baez in concert quot prof that once upon a time such thing were possible one thing you might notice a soon a you listen to the release there are no annoying hoot holler yell whistle etc etc a baez sings or a she quietly prepares to play one thing you will most certainly notice is the incredible quality of baez 's voice it wa one of popular music 's great instrument producing bell like tone of absolute purity and finally you will notice the quality of the material baez 's love of song that extend back in america 's and the world 's history is evident in her interpretation of much sung tune such a quot black is the color quot and quot babe i'm gonna leave you quot lest you think you are buying a hoary disc filled with dated protest song be assured that quot in concert quot contains very little overtly political material in fact the only pure protest song the excellent quot what have they done to the rain quot is a much poetry a protest and another of the disc 's high point the moonshine tune quot copper kettle quot leaven the performance with a dose of good humor this is music for quiet reflective moment a commodity in short supply today 

gospel ship is just a brief traditional hymn but it wa the first baez performance i ever heard and led me to become a fan this collection ha that one and a nice mixture of the traditional folk song which helped her get started near harvard in the late 1950 's and a few more contemporary piece i have been quite disappointed in this artist 's effort over the past decade but my oh my few folkies ever had a better first decade 

joan baez in concert part 2 where part 1 had joan doing an excellent job on the traditional folk catalog in part 2 she introduces u to some obscure little songwriter going by the name of bob dylan in this album she doe another excellent job on the traditional cut but nobody sings a dylan song better than joan baez and here we have her singing do n't think twice and with god on our side this is a great cd highly recommended 

this cd is quintessential early joan baez simply strumming her guitar and singing folk song that she love all but one of the track wa recorded at various concert during her tour in august 1962 and october november 1963 the sole exception is quot we shall overcome quot which wa recorded at mile college in birmingham alabama this cd is even better than joan baez in concert part 1 the selection of song is better a it contains more traditional folk song a fact that purist may wish to note these song serve to showcase her sweet clear soprano to perfection moreover her affection for this repertoire is evident in the feeling she evokes with her exquisite singing of these song this is particularly notable when she sings quot once i had a sweetheart quot quot jackaroe quot and quot queen of heart quot m baez also sings two song in portuguese quot manha de carnaval te ador quot one of the most beautiful and haunting song on this cd a well a the traditional quot nu bello cardillo quot she also give her own rousing interpretation to a perennial country favorite quot long black veil quot the cd also contains two bob dylan song the popular quot do n't think twice it 's alright quot a well a quot with god on our side quot the latter track one of dylan 's best song is done ample justice by the moving interpretation by m baez it is one of my favorite track on this cd this is a live concert recording so be prepared for clapping and an enthusiastic reception by the concert crowd a well a some crowd interaction and participation the audience join joan baez in singing quot we shall overcome quot 

joan 's voice couldnt fail during this period and this album contains many famous song once i had a sweetheart do n't think twice it alright etc i believe marianne faithfull wa very inspired by this album at the time a must have 

at the start of her career joan baez 's pure soulful voice wa the signature of the early 60 's folk movement it is perhaps best displayed on this album and on vol 1 of the same there is a special magic in her voice her guitar and the response of the appreciative audience the portuguese song on this album nu bello cardillo is touching but not a memorable a ate amanha on the first volume while there 's a lovely tremulous quality to her voice in the dylan song with god on our side my favorite on this second volume include the sorrowful tale of the long black veil and the traditionals hush little baby and battle hymn of the republic the audience participation on the hymn is very poignant and moving and turn into a rousing spiritual experience i personally prefer the first volume since more of those song have personal meaning to me but this folk classic is also an enduring treasure 

my theory is that the great young performer burst onto the scene with their pentup perception of the world gathered in their formative year that explode in their earlier work then their style mature settle down and sometimes grow or not often their best work is their first one this phenomenon exists in the career of joan baez a much a anyone when i wa going to school uc berkeley in the early 60 two woman i wa close to played the guitar and were inspired by joan baez who i had never heard of before it must have been common among a certain set of young woman who idolized joan who wa n't much older than they there are 5 cd one can consider to sample this period there is one called early joan baez a 2 cd set this ha all the song from her first four album two of which are quite obscure these were followed by two concert cd containing many of the same song of which this is the best both concert cd have some of the same song this one is the expanded version of the original vinyl chrystaline is the word often used to best describe her voice especially at this early age she wa influenced by the folk scene of course particularly by pete seeger and incorporated scottish and english ballad a well a american folksong from appalachia and elsewhere i recall 40 year ago a friend and his wife telling me they cry when they hear these song after all these year in which i have n't listened to these song much they retain their power three dylan song appear on this concert album the next album is farewell angelina which i believe ha 5 dylan 's original liner note appear a a long poem in whitmanesque fashion but more obliquely he conveys the effect joan had on him he with the gruff voice and representing nearly the opposite of her sensibility in many way he wonder how truth can come out of such purity he had assumed truth come out of only roughness and ugliness though they were romantically enmeshed the interplay between their musical persona wa complex a dance of opposite but sharing a deep sympathy for the human condition 

this bluegrass homage to bob dylan is surprisingly lively and fresh and oddly enough one of o'brien 's best most straightforwardly bluegrass y solo album scott nygaard jerry douglas and others pitch in on this good natured album spearheaded by the longtime hot rize mandolinist who ha since gone on into more high concept blue newgrass terrain here o'brien connects with dylan 's original old timey influence straightening out some of the kooky kink dylan had put into folk music back in his 'sixties heyday and transforming classic tune such a quot maggie 's farm quot and quot tombstone blue quot into straightforward galloping bluegrass breakdown nice to hear this music coming full circle back to it root 

no one ever pretended bob dylan had a pretty voice but he did do definitive version of his song so why should we pay money to hear a bluegrass artist do cover that sound markedly different from dylan 's original because the real magic of bob dylan 's music is that it is so malleable every important song he wrote ha more than one meaning more than one interpretation and his body of work ha been a gold mine for intellectual musician looking for a strong voice to adopt mercifully tim o'brien avoided the best known dylan tune like blowin' in the wind or mr tambourine man this is n't just a greatest hit retrospective it 's a cohesive artistic statement like blood on the track or john wesley harding one could imagine dylan himself running tombstone blue up against farewell angelina mustering little known piece like oxford town to keep the listener 's attention through the middle portion and crowning the sequence with forever young and lay down your weary tune yet for this artistic integrity and loftiness it 's still an album you can listen to more than once the bouncy upbeat tune on most of the track carry you along easily and even when the pace slows on song like wicked messenger or master of war the flawless ensemble playing and clear vocal make you want to continue listening this piece is a worthy addition to the body of work of tim o'brien but it 's also a wonderful statement for bob dylan and it 's a highly pleasing satisfying addition to the cd collection of any fan of either artist 

the world worship the ground bob dylan walk on gee what 's wrong with me i do n't but i 've tried my trial have led me to tim o'brien who ha interpreted bob 's song through bluegrass i'm not working for bobby 's farm no more but i might be working for tim 

the purchase of this cd i unashamedly confess came from my dylan curiosity having had 'lo behold' from mcguinness flint coulson dean devote an entire albumn to some of bob 's le well known 60 material what could a bluegrass boy come up with over similar terrain well nothing a bluesy a the aforementioned successful translation but the answer is absolutely thrilling i never tire of o'brien 's treatment of these song 'farewell angelina' the rap version of 'subterranean homesick blues' the whacky 'man gave name to all the animals' and a definitive version of 'forever young' the whole cd is an infectious pleasure he mention the possibility of taking a second bite at dylan 's catalogue i hope the response to this effort encourages that subsequently i followed his musical course back to ireland on 'the crossing' which is every bit the equal of 'red on blonde' a superlative set of original traditional and borrowed material joining him on this course amongst a host of legendary folk musician wa paul brady not an irish blood relative but a musical one to be sure it struck me what accord o'brien 's sweet tenor ha with the brady i first heard in the late 70 before he shifted from singing pretty much traditional or traditionally inspired song what company 

this album wa not tim o'brien 's attempt to make dylan 's music more pallatable which seems to be what some reviewer are saying but rather quot to find a batch of dylan tune that could be given an old time string band treatment quot a he explains in his liner note a couple night ago i saw o'brien perform at a bluegrass festival in lincoln while his set wa dominated by material from his two recent celtic influenced album 1999 's the crossing and 2001 's two journey he performed two song from red on blonde quot senor tale of yankee power quot and quot subturranean homesick blue quot the latter which he introduced a a kind of bluegrass rap complete with mark shatz 's ham bone body percussion i also used the opportunity to get an autographed copy of this album are o'brien 's treatment of these song an improvement upon the original i do n't think that wa his intent and in the end doe it really matter o'brien say in his liner note quot it 's one more chance to survey dylan 's output and hopefully enjoy it in a new way quot if you enjoy old time music with lot of mandolin fiddle and banjo you 'll enjoy this heartfelt offering o'brien also hint at a quot volume two quot i ca n't wait highly recommended 

when i bring up jayo to a lot of my friend they asked me damn what happened to him with the rapper from san diego signing a deal with def jam he wa able to release his debut album take a ride we all know how def jam treat west coast artist so i'm pretty sure that there wa n't much behind this album to me i find jayo to be a rapper who talk about what he ha been through most of his song are about how he ha gotten into jail and ran the street of san diego all backed by some great west coast production that wa popular around the time the west coast hit it 's peak in 1994 '95 most of these track jayo rarely switch up his subject matter so expect a lot of gangsta topic on the majority of the track the loc is on his own i'ma keep bangin' are all dedicated to his lifestyle that he life the production on the latter song will keep you interested sherm stick is the tune to the old r b song come and go with me a jayo rhyme about getting smoked out brothas sistas or track 7 wa one of the single for this album and ride a heavy basslines and synths thats cool ca n't keep a gee down is another banging song to ride to further on the album the short song do n't call me a is dope they got me on medication is a standout in my opinion funk 2 da head is my favorite track a jayo flow perfectly with the dope beat take a ride sound decent but not a standout a couple of filler track in the middle of the album like i'm through but that doe n't make the album bad overall excellent album from jayo his rhyme style is great in my opinion this album ha that southern cali vibe that many people who are fan of gangsta rap would appriciate the next albumwhatcha gonna do would follow up three year later which is a little more commercial but great and is worth picking up a well peace lyric b production b guest appearance n amusical vibe a top 5 track 1 funk 2 da head2 medication3 ca n't keep a gee down4 i'ma keep bangin'5 brothas sistas 

jayo felony 's 1995 debut album is a west coast classic one of the most overlooked masterpiece of g funk and a personal favorite of my collectoin unfortunately this album also displayed def jam 's complete ineptitude to promote west coast artist just ask richie rich twinz the dove shack wc south central cartel or even warren g what 's so great about this album is that jayo is much more insightful than the average g funker he 's a true lyricist but his subject matter really set him apart from his west coast contemporary he ha beef with the legal and prison system and on many track he vent out his frustration with the law and incarceration his tale of street crime penitentiary life and loneliness are really engaging and interesting a a rapper jayo constantly demand and maintains your attention his flow really help this too he 's got a lazy and conversational delivery that make his rap feel more personal he switch this up sometimes almost singing a few hook but the production is also spectacular it 's so focused especially because there 's not a single guest verse or appearance on the whole album the music ha deep bass but the instrumentals are a little more stripped down than most of the g funk coming out at this time it 's not so woozy and computerized either it ha a great feel and is often upbeat and very catchy the dark gloomy funk enhances jayo 's portrayal of a grim world where penitentiary stay are punctuated by gang violence and drug abuse this album ha absolutely no weak track the consistency is something rare in this genre and that 's what make take a ride such a classic even the skit are relevant and entertaining while this album is still available unlike his other two i consider this a must have and this is an awesome underappreciated classic following the intro the first song is the loc is on his own a nice cut this song is slow and funky and the lyric are some of the best jayo recount the difficulty with contacting and connecting with his friend and family following incarceration it 's conscious and an interesting take he also drop some raw philosophy on the jail system i'ma keep bangin' is faster and bouncier the production is very nice and jayo hold your attention with his rough profile of urban life homicide is pretty laidback jayo show true lyrical talent on this track the nice love boat skit serf a an intro to this album 's classic single sherm stick over a sunny head nodding beat jayo lace a smoking anthem with a great hook and verse i also really like n s and b s another excellently produced track and ca n't keep a gee down continues the roll of funky upbeat track with intense lyricism my favorite beat here is found on b i'm through which musically is the finest track the woozy bumping beat ha awesome instrumentals and a great hook a well penitentiary bound is awesome on this song jayo tell the story of a parole violation that led to incarceration and he explores injustice in the system the short yet inspiring do n't call me n is a real highlight and my favorite song come next they got me on medication jayo 's delivery on this song is totally on point and the production is excellent he tell story about hood life and insanity with the law leading to the awesome hook funk 2 da head is appealing but not outstanding and the album finish with the title track an incredibly catchy and upbeat west coast anthem it 's embarrassing that an album so great both lyrically and musically could have gone so under the radar but the combination of lack of promotion and a flood of g funk album in '95 made this one of the year 's slept on gem just like bg knocc out dresta 'sreal brothasand twinz'conversation jayo is one of those rapper that seems to have been on the verge of stardom at one point but for whatever reason it never really happened for him regardless take a ride is the album that wa the first to put san diego on anybody 's hip hop radar fan of west coast rap will love this and anybody can appreciate the emotional lyric and funky beat 

i do n't know what to make of def jam signing dope west coast act and then pretty much hanging them out to dry if you look at the def jam catalog during the mid ninety you 'll find potent album from the like of warren g south central cartel dove shack jayo felony and quite a few others i'm not saying these artist are the best the west have to offer but they were very promising prospect at the time think about the promotion these artist got or did n't get it 's not a coincidence that the cali artist got no shine on def jam or def jam west anyway this album is tight smoothed out funky beat passionate lyric that speak on bangin' slangin' maintainin' i mean you ca n't help but feel jayo when he speaks even the interlude skit have a place on this lp unlike a lot of album that come out nowadays with highly unnecessary skit if you 're expecting a lot of that rapid fire choppy flow stuff that he doe today you may want to look for later release this is basically just jay puttin' it down gangsta style a far a flaw there are n't many there are a few joint that i did n't particularly feel but i would n't necessarily call them bad song homicide they got me on medication and b ch i'm through are the song that i speak of def jam 's decision to totally ignore album from their west coast signees should be viewed a nothing le than their attempt to disembowel the west when they were in a position to remove the east coast from their top spot i ca n't think of any other reason for them to ignore great album like this one and the other banger that i mentioned earlier the beat are tight and jayo ha a flow unlike most that you will find out there there simply should 've been more done on def jam 's part take a ride is a vintage mid 90 's rap album that should be looked into i recommend adding this album to your collection if you can find it standout track ca n't keep a gee down do n't call me ni a sherm stick i'ma keep bangin' ni a and bi e penitentiary bound and the loc is on his own 

jayo felony 's debut album take a ride slam and satisfies from start to finish he is raw and rugged throughout the beat here are hard core g funk with vicious and rapid fiery flow song like i'mma keep bangin they got me on medication the loc is on his own show case his hard but unique persona he put san diego on the map and show no mercy 

this album is a str8 classic the three best traccs are homicide bitch i'm through penitentiary bound one of the classic from the west you can play this album from start to finish from the loc is on his own 2 take a ride 

this dude flow and lyrical prowess is truly amazing he reminds me a bit of rakim the pro black nation of islam type lyric are not enough to bother me either his anti white lyric are overshadowed by his gift on the mic and the hard hitting funky a hell beat behind him cop this cd if you are into politically conscience rapid fire flow lyric with some amazing beat this is one of the hottest cd that you 've probably never heard 

how did i find out about paris i wa up north and i went to fye and saw his second album sleeping with the enemy staring me in the face i picked it up listened to it and fell in love with the whole album i bought the rest of his album from amazon and let just saw i dont regret buying them at all if you love political hip hop then you must support paris listen to this album and you 'll see why he wa intentionally kept away from u standout track scarface groove this is a test panther power break the grip of shame warning ebony this color called ebony brutal somewhat sound like ll in the second half of this track the devil made me do it the hate that hate made mellow madness on a jazz tip i call him mad dj mad mike wa on fire escape from babylon and wretched filler none bottom line paris give you what you want from this excellent debut political and social commentary just the way you true lover of hip hop like it make this album a definite part of your collection 

at a time when almost all west coast rap wa about gang banging car etc paris took it to another level his panther power showed that the ideology of the black panther party wa far from dead in oakland paris public enemy boogie down production and x clan represented the level of black consciousness in hip hop in the late 1980 's and early 1990 's this is a underrated album 

just read this morning that paris wa shot and killed came here to check out the artist because i 'd never heard of him what a shame this is a must have for the collection 

paris is one of the many hip hip artist from the early 1990 's that didnt get alot of airplay and mainly sold record on word of mouth let me tell you that even though paris 's other release are n't a strong a this the devil made me do it ha flavor that most hip hop ha lost today and that is dealing with racial tension political issue and black history ex black panther the beat are also mind blowing and this album is very hard for the time that it wa released even though the album is somewhat dated it still is a treasure and i hope people that are infactuated with today hip hop could take a few step back and pick up an album of such importance this cd belongs in everyones collection it that good i only gave if 4 star because even though it is a classic there are some poor filler tune here enjoy 

after getting his major debut in the group the madd circle with west coast rapper wc coolio came out with his solo debut it take a thief back in 1994 his debut wa able to blend in with the popular west coast rap scene around that time here coolio take you through a tale of story before he became a recording artist the album 's concept is interesting but at the same time get kind of repetitive but the overall product is highly enjoyable for one fan to like with the lead single fantastic voyage coolio creates a track for one to bounce to county line and mama i'm in love with a gangsta he rhyme about being broke and being locked away for some time the latter track feature up and coming rapper leshaun you might recognize her from ll cool j 's doin' it who drop an okay verse further down the album are track like can o corn and sticky finger where he reminisces over time he used to shoplift to get by in life the album 's title track is one of the biggest highlight on the album a coolio tell story on how he used to rob people for their good n da closet is another standout a he explains about the effect of his drug habit the end of the album i remember is another great track that feature j ro from the alkaholiks and billy boy given that this is an excellent album coolio misstep on such song like ghetto cartoon and on my way to harlem both track are one of the few that failed to standout in my opinion overall coolio 's debut wa a great album coolio sound very motivated and hungry a he strives to keep his lyrical content above the average i enjoyed the content that he placed here on this album and it will keep a listener interested given that this is out of print and only sell for a penny this is one purchase i would recommend especially those who are new to coolio and are on the fence about his material peace lyric b production b guest appearance b musical vibe a top 5 track 1 it take a thief2 i remember featuring j ro and billy boy 3 n da closet4 fantastic voyage5 county linehonorable mention 1 mama i'm in love with a gangsta featuring leshaun 2 u know hoo featuring w c 

fantastic voyage is the only good song on this excuse for an album the rest of the song are not even the least bit interesting the other song are n't even worth listening to unless you are coolio 's 1 fan then do n't this unless it 's used for real cheap none of the song seem like quot fantastic voyage quot and that is what turned me off 

it 's the hip hop 's hair doo master coolio on a debut album my locc coolio went from b g to locc 'sta from compton ca aka the cpt like i said on my review from gangsta 's paradice coolio be blowin' on some indo or some other type of funky gangee because coolio wa the locc who released the ultimate house party groove fantastic voyage by far coolio 's dopest hit county line is a far out dope song by my locc ghetto cartoon is a funny cartoonished song with funny lyric and my locc ha another good one called ugly bitch what it 's a true song by my locc coolio 

this album absolutely kick the snot out of 95 of the music to come since picking highlight for this album is difficult but here 's a couple ghetto cartoon coolio give you a rather twisted urban fairy tale featuring all the wb and disney character hilarious and deft gangsta 's paradise the title track to a major movie and one of they very few rap song that go for 'haunting' and achieves it mama i'm in love wit a gangsta told half in telephone conversation and all in style just buy the album already 

it 's the hip hop 's hair doo master coolio on a debut album my locc coolio went from b g to locc 'sta from compton ca aka the cpt like i said on my review from gangsta 's paradice coolio be blowin' on some indo or some other type of funky gangee because coolio wa the locc who released the ultimate house party groove fantastic voyage by far coolio 's dopest hit county line is a far out dope song by my locc ghetto cartoon is a funny cartoonished song with funny lyric and my locc ha another good one called ugly bitch what it 's a true song by my locc coolio hair doo master 's best yet is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 did i miss any song 

gangsta 's paradise the song still is one of my most played song in my car there are several other noteworthy song too with all the new rap cd on the market now a day sometimes it is just nice to kick back and listen to one of the classic 

now i'm not a big coolio fan but i 've just always liked the song quot gangsta 's paradise quot even though that 's the initial reason i bought the album there are many more good song on it i like the song quot ghetto highlight quot almost a much a the title track quot sumpin new 1 2 3 4 quot is a pretty catchy tune i used to hear at roller skate place a lot those are my 3 favorite song but i also like the song quot kinda high kinda drunk quot and quot exercise yo' game quot the only reason i took off a star is because since this is an edited album there are a couple of song that could be good that are edited so much it take away from the song 

back in late 1995 coolio had his most popular single gangsta 's paradise floating all through the airwave i must have been about 10 year old and managed to learn that song in under an hour almost 13 year later i can barely remember any of the word coolio wa n't really the greatest rapper from the west coast but the single gangsta 's paradise wa the jump that he needed to place himself to where he wanted to be in the rap game true when you think of his name that single pop up but there wa just more than that single that made him a good rapper in fact a lot of the track bang a coolio talk mostly about the street of l a ghetto highlites is a song how he talk about life in the ghetto too hot is a great song about people being burned while not using protection using the kool and the gang song then he ha some bouncy track like 1 2 3 4 sumpin' new which doe sound a little cheesy but to me it 's good guest appearance are good though i like crusin featuring malika e 40 kam and coolio 's group 40 thevez colab for exercize yo game and w c 40 thevez shorty and ra ka appear on get up get down all dope song my favorite song on this album would be coolio colabing with will wheaton on the song bright a the sun although good album it flaw heavily i personally think this album ha too many recognizable interpolation which make the song sound so cheesy a perfect example would be a thing going on us the chorus to me and mr jones kinda high and drunk is another bad song gangsta 's paradise is a very good album it wa one of the biggest highlight album in late '95 carried over to '96 unfortunately back then this album wa played into the ground and people were tired of coolio which might explain why his next albummy souldid n't sell like he wanted to i would n't necessarly call coolio a gangsta rapper he just happened to be from the west and blew up when gangsta rap wa at it 's peak this album here is great and is being sold for a penny and it 's well worth your purchase peace lyric bproduction bguest appearance a musical vibe b top 5 track 1 bright a the sun featuring will wheaton 2 gangsta 's paradise featuring l v 3 get up get down featuring 40 thevz shorty ra ka and w c 4 exercize yo game featuring e 40 kam and 40 thevz 5 crusin' featuring malika honorable mention 1 too hot2 1 2 3 4 sumpin' new 

i bought this album mainly for gangsta's paradise i 've never been a huge coolio fan but i liked the song there were a couple of other good song on the album especially the one with the guest appearance by wc the shadiest the lyric and the beat on that were pretty tight the rest of the album wa enjoyable but nothing outstanding the lyric were nothing special and the production wa mediocre he needed more work from crazy toones this album is n't a must have unless you 're a coolio fan but it 's enjoyable 

because sucker by it quickly get bored by it then try to sell it except there are more sucker than buyer gangsta indeed only an idiot think gangsta 's are good at making music ok the dumbos who disagree can now press the not helpful button and the smart people can at least consider what i 've written 

this cd is pretty tight but it got way overplayed gangsta 's paradise too hot exercise yo' game smilin' bright a the sun sumpin' new are some tight song but after hearin 'em on the radio all day everyday you start to not like them but i listened to this the other day and after not hearing it for a while i rembered how it wa a good cd cpt 

i since download every song that wa on this cd coolio put it down right here by mixing r b funk old school and some gangsta like can make it sound of 2day 's west coast gangsta rap leader dr dre snoop dogg mc hammer n w a eazy e the d o c warren g tone loc young mc 50 cent g unit you name it we definitely know the song he 's best known for which is gangsta 's paradise i wa only 10 or 11 when this came out before the controversy between the east coast and west coast rap feud they had goin' on since i watch the behind the music interview on biggie small aka the notorious b i g p diddy etc this is definitely goin in2 my collection alongside dr dre 's the chronic 2pac 's classic all eyez on me the notorious b i g 's ready to die and life after death nas' illmatic n w a 's straight outta compton twista 's kamikaze big pun 's capital punishment queen latifah 's black reign etc 

but sadly it 's not enough to save the album except for that one song the album fails on many level even for rap music with it 's anoying lyric bad beat and even bad rapping personally i think this guy ha got some talent and is just afraid to use it he proved he 's got the skill to be one of the greatest rapper out there with quot gangsta 's paradise quot and in the quot space jam quot soundtrack he with the help of other rapper helped make the best rap song i 've herd he just need to use some of his talent and he could go far and shove cheap rapper like eminem out of the way 

a a child coolio wa a b g locc from compton ca although coolio ran with the compton loccs coolio had trouble fitting in with his school mate and at the age of 17 coolio got into the crack cocaine game although coolio may not of been a sucessful a eazy e ice cube dr dre or snoop doggy dogg coolio 's 1996 album gangsta 's paradice is a west coast highlight best hit defiently is the hit song gangsta 's paradice though another song that should of been a hit is cruisin' sumpin' new is another good hit by coolio and a good house party song is kinda high kinda drunk coolio 's best are 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 12 13 16 17 

in an age of boom boom dance music and overblown hyperamplified grunge i wa inclined to think that when i heard coolio 's gangsta 's paradise even a i wa knowing about what gangsta meant in relation to rap wa something a little better the fact wa is that this style of synthesised semimelodic rap today sound like the perfect prototype for yes the backstreet boy and britney spear coolio clearly sounded like he wanted to remove the melody and the hook that at least made commcercial music from the eighty easy to listen to well i listened to nothing but for the best part of two decade and replace it with a synthesised airy flyweight sound that would serve perfectly a background music on your commercial station the song is not memorable like hit single of the 1980s were and the singer can never tell whether he want to talk or actually to sing this wa perhaps the first song to be a hit a background music on the radio rather than from simple catchy lyric and vocal that had made hit single before a it stand today this soundtrack rap album is almost a protype for the backstreet boy who sound quite similar to coolio actually even if they never rapped if you like the backstreet boy or n'sync no need for rudeness you 'll love this for the meandering melody and total absence of memorable rhythm if you want more substance stay right away coolio copy stevie wonder 's pasttime paradise on this one going back to the source would be most welcome 

if there is a rap classic gangsta 's paradise would be on the list i gave this cd a a christmas stocking stuffer a young friend asked me about it and wondered where he could get cd i found it on amazon it wa a joy to see his face when he pulled it from his stocking a song like gangsta paradise is timeless the struggle are still there 

quot gangsta 's paradise quot is getting to be a quite old rap song but it 's still probably one of the best ever it definitely go on the top of my all time favorite rap song list i gave this cd 3 star because quot gangsta 's paradise quot is the only song i 've heard off this album i'm sure the rest of the album is pretty decent too but quot gangsta 's paradise quot will probably always be one of the best rap song if you love coolio 's music than this is a really great cd and you must have it otherwise if you only like quot gangsta 's paradise quot then i suggest buying the cd single for it or the soundtrack for dangerous mind totally awesome song probably coolio 's best i just love it 

not the best from coolio the compton o g but also not the worsest cd in hip hop either the cd is worth bumpin but my favorite is get up get down with cameo 's from 40 thevs and the only reason i wanted to hear the cd wa because i wanted to hear a guest spot from wc and glad to see i was'nt let down 

coolio came out again in 1995 with the hit gangsta 's paradise on the dangerous mind soundtrack he then released his second album taking the same name this album ha some special meaning for me it wa only the second rap album i bought ever the album is a fun pop mainstream style album full of great production and beat and some nice rhyme by coolio beatwise the album is full of that cali g funk courtesy of wino vic c and many lesser known producer way too many to list here gangsta 's paradise is obviously a hit but there are many other classic here too is this me is hella twangy feat rated r from thug life discussing the hold the street take on people who get caught up in that life coolio show some love and respect for the woman on for my sistas sumpin' new is just a plain good time at the club over a bouncy p funk sampled type beat a fun a fantastic voyage from 1994 get up get down feature longtime homie wc and homegirl malika the beat is smooth and swingin the revolution is hot with a bouncy lowrider beat dealing with social issue bright a the sun is a track where the imagery brings up a helicopter ghetto bird ha it bright light searching for him over a woozy twangy beat i love exercise yo' game with coolio trading spit with kam e 40 and 40 thevz which ha an oddball but phat beat i love the hooter and licqor joint kinda high kinda drunk with another odd but tight beat coolio ha some positive message in many track he ha fun but he also can bring up some serious often sad imagery on track like geto highlites which is basically what it is run like a news report in part of the song the album brings back memory of growing up for me i see many hating on the album for being too pop but i disagree it is a nice album regardless 

quot gangsta paradise quot is pretty good for being edited the only song that were worth listening to are quot gangsta paradise quot quot exercise yo game quot and quot kinda high kinda drunk quot i suggest that you pick up the explicit version 

thanx to this musical blockbuster her voice is forever engraved in my mind and what a great voice it is it 's a club dance album and a well crafted pop album at the same time song here have irresistible melody hook beat and nice synths lyric are sometimes a little simplistic being about love and a bit repetitive this album had quite a rotation on my cd player in mid 90 's and my repeat button wa working some overitme on many track here so this album always take me back to that time this album wa produced by berman brother who produced real mccoy and she move most song here were written by them and amber mc cremers song range from fast eurodance song with great techno beat typical berman brother stuff at that time these are 1 this is your night 2 move your body 8 hold my body tight 9 can you feel the love 3 color of love 6 push it to the limit the two remixes were nothing special though now there are also some really nice slower song on this one and these are very soulful 4 you are the one 5 one more night a beautiful slower song for a slower dance 10 losing myself in your love written by joel kipnis 12 this is the right time prduced by junior vasquezand there are also some cover on this cd that are ok being with you let it rain overall this is a great melodic and soulful album that will pick up your spirit anytime a must have if you like commercial dance music thank you 

this album is quite bouncy fun friendly and good while i would n't call it quot techno techno quot it certainly is dance which a the catagorization would lead one to belive will certainly get you dancing euro pop rule and so doe amber who is a quite a talented woman this album is reccomended 

back in the mid to late '90s when i wa still in college i wa a big fan of euro pop music one of my favorite euro pop artist wa amber i loved her first two album her debut album this is your night wa an album chockful of some of the catchiest pop song i had ever heard i especially loved the single this is your night which wa found all over various dance compilation at the time and colour of love i especially loved the second single colour of love probably because it did n't get a much a airplay a this is your night which quickly got overplayed this is your night is n't completely flawless some of the song were really silly lyrically like move your body push it to the limit and hold my body tight if the silly cheesy lyric were n't enough i wa n't that big of the song that had a more of an r b influence like move your body but then again i did like one more night my favorite song on the cd ha to be can you feel the love i just love the synthesized beat and the melody of the song it still remains a one of my favorite song by amber to this very day even though my taste in music ha changed i still enjoy listening to amber from time to time to break the monotony 

very generic no soul no substance no life no emotion from the artist no creativity no nothing 

if you like amber and do not have this album you need to get it immediately it is a great work out cd which will have you pumped from beginning to end alot of the song have the title traks beat and energy in my opinion this cd is better than the second she released and i like that one too 

you really have the impression somehow that she ca n't sing also the song do n't seem spectacular it 's weak dancey stuff like dj bobo and all those act this is really a no go for me 

amber 's debut album wa a clear example of how can a dance album could be consistent and provocative well done produced mainly by the berman brother this is your night became a cherish house dance album for any club lover the best track are the one that fall in the cliche of topic song in club anthemic track like this is your night the title track ha become one of the representers of the 90 's dance music almost available in any dance collection that it 's out there it 's obvious what the hit wa all about the thing is that the song worked work and will work a great dance tune colour of love wa a more pop in tune oriented very cheesy but still danceable one more night sad that the hit dance version it 's not available in the album since it 's one of the best hit of amber the slower ballad soulful version it 's included here not bad but not good still the lyrcis own that magical message push it to the limit it 's a euro dance track repetitive but it just infatuates you great tune being with you it 's another pop tune average this is the right time junior vasquez put his hand on this a great midtempo dance track let it rain very nice slow jam a very emotional one above all amber debut album feature a moving dance club reacord that would be remember a a move foward to amber since she keep a consistent career in the dance club after this album and is one of the most recognized voice in america 's joint 

this album accually get a 4 5 from me but the misfit are too good for me to give anything under a 5 earth ad wolfsblood is awesome but much different from anything that the misfit have ever done before many of these song are extremely fast nothing else wa a fast or brutal before this album and nothing else is a fast or brutal today but it 's very good it contains some very superb misfit song like earth ad devilock death come ripping green hell mommy can i go out and kill tonight demonomania bloodfeast we bite and my personal favorite die die my darling if there 's any bad thing about this album it 's these three song wolfsblood queen wasp and hellhound they 're not bad song at all but they all sound exactly the same and imo they 're kinda boring i do n't hate em they 're just not favorite they 're average so if you 're looking for a punk metal album with an extreme amount of originality go for this hell buy all their album it 's dark creepy brutal and will leave you bleeding and in stitch and begging for more 

if you read any of my other review you will hear my go on and on about the misfit and what an influence they had have on me so why only the one star because if youll notice the track list it is simply the last 7 song on the collection 1 album and the last 5 on the collection 2 so you may already own this and not even know it just buy collection 1 and 2 and you will then have this album too 

i ca n't stop listening to these song especially 3 4 5 6 9 and 12 help me 

this album is fast hard core punk with catchy melody different line up from walk among u of course glenn is singin' jerry only is on bass doyle on guitar and robo from black flag on drum highlight of the album is die die my darling another song that wa covered by metallica 

say what you will about quot static age quot or quot walk among u quot quot earth a d quot the final album from the danzig era misfit is the quintessential punk thrash album of it 's time featuring the best drumming of the danzig era misfit let 's be honest the drumming ha always been kind of lackluster but that 's besides the point and a harder edge in term of attitude and vocal quot earth a d quot is nothing short of pure energetic ear candy from start to finish featuring classic track like quot green hell quot quot die die my darling quot and the title track plus fan favorite like quot devilock quot quot death come ripping quot and quot mommy can i go out amp kill tonight quot quot earth a d quot is not only a must have for any and every serious misfit fan but an excellent introduction for new fan to the band metallica 's cover of quot green hell quot and quot die die my darling quot are nothing compared to the original 

earth a d is probably the heaviest most aggressive recording the misfit have ever released this cd feature their famous song die die my darling a well a many other great song wolf 's blood is a twisted portrait of a man who is transforming into a werewolf danzig 's howl of pain and aggression are amazing and the frantic guitar and drum in the song make it a favorite queen wasp and earth a d are very heavy song although those two track in particle do n't have great sound quality right after this album wa released thrash metal wa unleashed in the world of rock coincidence perhaps but this cd obviously had to have some influence on the artist of the category pick this one up today 

i went and bought this cd and i wa not dissapointed with it at all i heard very good thing about it and i rushed out to get it a soon a i could in my opinion it is one of the greatest misfit cd 's ever made every song on it is no le than perfect such a quot earth a d quot quot die die my darling quot quot we bite quot quot wolf blood quot quot blood feast quot and many more if your a real die hard misfit fan like me than go out and get this cd it is a classic in my book 

with this misfit offering you can see where glenn danzig wa heading musically and lyrically actually you can look at it a his first solo album then again he like to credit all album he 's associated with a solo album no two misfit album sound alike but this one is the most off the track they ever got excluding the new album it really doe n't sound like the misfit at all but it doe retain that catchiness we all love the sound quality of this album is rotten it sound like the recording equipment wa located a block away from the band and buried under the ground i originally heard this on cassette when i wa 14 imagine how much worse the sound quality wa on that this make the lyric completely undecipherable it help if you have the box set which contains the lyric which give you the unique opportunity to make up your own got a potato green hell however this album is good and should be added to your collection unfortunately it 's way too short after you start it up do n't leave the room to grab your cafe au lait and a bundt cake or you 'll miss it
