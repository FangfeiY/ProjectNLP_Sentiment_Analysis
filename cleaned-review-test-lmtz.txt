it 's hard to believe memory of tree came out 11 year ago it ha held up well over the passage of time it 's enya 's last great album before the new age pop of amarantine and day without rain back in 1995 enya still had her creative spark her own voice i agree with the reviewer who said that this is her saddest album it is melancholy bittersweet from the opening title song memory of tree is elegaic majestic pax deorum sound like it is from a requiem mass it is a dark threnody unlike the reviewer who said that this ha a disconcerting blend of spirituality sensuality i do n't find it disconcerting at all anywhere is is a hopeful song looking to possibility hope ha a place is about love but it is up to the listener to decide if it is romantic platonic etc i 've always had a soft spot for this song on my way home is a triumphant ending about return this is truly a masterpiece of new age music a must for any enya fan 

a clasically styled and introverted album memory of tree is a masterpiece of subtlety many of the song have an endearing shyness to them soft piano and a lovely quiet voice but within every introvert is an inferno and enya let that fire explode on a couple of song that absolutely burst with an expected raw power if you 've never heard enya before you might want to start with one of her more popularized work like watermark just to play it safe but if you 're already a fan then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art 

i never thought enya would reach the sublime height of evacuee or marble hall from 'shepherd moon ' 'the celt watermark and day ' were all pleasant and admirable throughout but are le ambitious both lyrically and musically but hope ha a place from 'memory ' reach those height and beyond it is enya at her most inspirational and comforting i'm actually glad that this song did n't get overexposed the way only time did it make it that much more special to all who own this album 

this is the third review of an irish album i write today the others were cranberry and now i'm sure about that ireland is one of the country producing the best music in the world and not just commercial pop music in the spice girl way okay i just wanted to say something about irish music now let 's say something about this album it 's great it 's beautiful very good easy listened music if you like enya or you just want some easy listened relaxing music this is the album for you to buy 

enya despite being a successful recording artist doe n't have the broad appeal a other artist one reason might be that her kind of music is not very pop station friendly while another reason could be people think they 're too macho for music that she make but people with open mind could find there 's some beautiful melody and harmony a well a lively upbeat tune that are a joy to put on i find the memory of tree to be one of her most consistent album plus it help it ha probably one of my top 5 favorite song ever the memory of tree like all of her record except the recent amarantine the album open with a wordless instrumental and this album 's title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggio and a beautiful vocal track i always like the sparse use of percussion 9 10anywhere is the lively single it 's actually a good sing along with staccato beat and a great chorus it 's also a perfect length since it 's under 3 minute so whereas some pop song drag after awhile this one hook you in then let you go leaving you wanting more 9 10pax deorum another album another ominous latin sung piece the music sound like something you 'd hear in enemy territory in video game while enya give a low voice almost monotone performance over the music slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice come in but the piece hit it stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge 8 10athair ar nearmh there 's some song she doe where it 's more about the song itself rather than a poppy catchy quality a la only time and this song 's similar another ballad with some of her best singing it 's a more low key track but it 's also one of the album highlight 8 5 10from where i am another instrumental this one 's a more piano based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianist out there since it 's not technically complex or fast but it 's pleasant to listen to 7 5 10china rose there 's only a handful of song i could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them everything from the vocal and background instrumentation the lyric and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending coda i 've ever heard this is definately my favorite song on here plus her whole career even 15 10hope ha a place for me any song after china rose will probably suffer a tad but this song doe n't do much for me granted her vocal are a great a always and the song ha a nice relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar a kind of athair part 2 if you will or it 's just not a memorable 7 10tea house moon very oriental in it instrument it 's another wordless song although it 's more enjoyable than from where i am is mainly because the melody are more memorable and it 's a bit more song oriented it 's different but strangely likable 8 10once you had gold we 're getting into the album 's final stretch and the problem is that with this one it 's a more quieter affair a you can feel the album almost winding down with enya 's more higher vocal for some reason reminiscent of her silent night rendition it 's another beautiful track but it 's also a bit same y 8 10la sonadora spanish lyric for once it 's another slower paced track complete with aahs for background vocal and synths but again the album could 've benefited from a more perkier track i do like what it doe at the halfway point and give the track a little boost 7 5 10on my way home a church organ open the track and with a more bouncy synth you 'd think it wa a bit more upbeat while it 's not a lively a her vocal on anywhere is it doe give the album a bit more memorable closer especially when the chorus come where the track get more fuller in it arrangement 9 10while a day without rain or watermark is usually marked a one of her best probably because her big hit only time and orinoco flow were on them i find the memory of tree a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat track it 's still one of her finest outing 

who know why i initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world maybe i wa expecting shepherd 's moon part ii and saw memory of tree a shepherd 's eclipse the song did n't leap out to me well listening to it for this review it finally did and i 've embraced it like i have her other album the four year inbetween album wa worth it of the opening instrumental title track quot the memory of tree quot is the most potent sporting the usual instrumentals piano haunting wall of sound choir like vocal pounding drum recalling quot the longships quot from watermark the brisk quot anywhere is quot whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park is backed by string and backing vocal there 's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another where something that look like an end is actually a new beginning bit like life is n't it quot pax deorum quot is a latin track begin with a cold dark wind which set the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song a well a an ominous sound that sound a bit like a foghorn though not a loud or brash this part sound a bit like an incantation her voice alternate between a soft but lower register and her full vocal the piano and later some other instrument ballad quot athair ar neamh quot is a sad but beautiful sung tune full of yearning make me want to learn gaelic my favourite song here and enya sound her best singing like this the wistful reflective piano only instrumental quot from where i am quot is a variation of quot miss clare remembers quot from watermark with some shade of quot epona quot from the enya album quot china rose quot is one of her visual and visionary poetic song and it 's an enchanting delight to hear i see melodic strain of what would later become quot only time quot that wall of sound really enhances her vocal and the following lyric really create the image of a dreamland quot a new moon lead me to wood of dream and i follow a new world wait for me my dream my way quot and quot rain and river a world of wonder may be paradise to me quot gosh how i love this woman ok all you romantic quot hope ha a place quot is the song for you enya 's vocal echo hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom and how 's this for some sagely advice quot look to love you may dream and if it should leave then give it wing but if such a love is meant to be hope is home and the heart is free quot i ca n't decide whether i like this better than quot athair ar neamh quot the third instrumental quot tea house moon quot ha some oriental strain with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the star a for the title a nod to teahouse of the august moon set in post ww2 japan and starring machiko kyo quot once you had gold quot is a proverbial season come season go type and ha a mystical sense of why thing go wrong quot no one can promise a dream for you time gave both darkness and dream to you quot and quot what is the dark shadow around you why not take heart in the new day quot quot la sonadora quot is her first spanish song and it 's more an interlude the backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song 's midsection a reminiscing night traveller 's thought comprise quot on my way home quot where quot i remember all the best day i'm on my way home i can remember every new day quot is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound compared to her first three album enya 's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than i 've ever heard she seems to be a one woman band here a it 's quot all instrument and vocal by enya quot per the credit there 's more a wall of dreamy sound here check out how many time i 've mentioned this repeated listening will tell whether it 'll dislodge shepherd 's moon a my favourite enya album 

enya is one of a few artist whom i consider successful at creating this type of electronic atmospheric and dreamlike music for certain the memory of tree is melodic romantic and sensuous rom ryan 's lyric sung in gaelic by enya athair ar neamh float gently like pillow soft white cloud the composition are relaxing and harmonious tea house moon dreamlike and filled with mystery once you had gold and include subtle touch of celtic tradition enya 's phrasing on `hope ha a place' the cd is a quiet and lush alternative to ninety percent of the popular music on the market today and also a welcome substitute for the often hectic pace of daily life enya 's arrangement of the composition on memory is well thought the comparatively dramatic and uplifting `anywhere is' and `on my way home' are placed so that the listener doe n't fall asleep however i'm very leery when i read a dozen review of a particular musical release and all the writer rate the artist 's work with five star my hesitation is not a matter of taste listener are free to condemn or rave about whatever they please but one of perspective is the memory of tree a musical ground breaking effort doe it introduce a unique technique or significantly alter a current genre of popular music on close listening the electronic pseudo symphonic music of memory doe not approach the beauty or dynamic of an orchestra with real people playing real instrument nor doe enya 's multi layering of her own voice have the same rich sonic texture a a chorus comprised of real voice then again perhaps the memory of tree and all of enya 's work is so provocatively ethereal because it is surreal 

enya is one of of the most mysterious singer in music today i consider her to be one of the few female singer who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melody that do n't sound banal or cheap even though some of her song are so short a to be almost like unfinished demo tape will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minute long the memory of tree is my second favorite cd of hers behing watermark which i consider to be her strongest outing to date i doubt enya will topple watermark to tell you the truth many people say that this is a sunny album well it is kind of true the sunniness is evidenced on the title track anywhere is and the orinoco flow esque on my way home generally i think of this album a an album for a cloudy romantic autumn evening with the leaf a bright red orange and yellow several song are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let 's say storm in africa exile or creepy like evening fall this album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundary i find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of a day without rain which followed this one five year later i usually go with the darker material that enya doe but i enjoy the brighter material a well i love music that is dark and stormy the title track is a gorgeous instrumental that ha enya returning to the day of the celt cd instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced u to watermark shephard moon and a day without rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beat to bop your head to combined with enyas multilayered vocal that start out a a cloudy minor note and after about 30 second it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the cloud on a warm autumn afternoon this song is more similar to the celt than the piano instrumentals of most of her album although this song is much brighter than the celt title track anywhere is is like the blueprint of enyas big selling a day without rain it 's a very bright sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with this song is more legato although there are hint of the staccato pizzicato string that would dominate a lot of enyas a day without rain i love the quiet middle part of the song it kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of orinoco flow a few year before then after the sunniness we head into darker mistier territory of pax deorum this song is another dark almost gothic piece that feature enya singing in latin with a very misty feel in the middle of the song the rhythm pause and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark cloud i consider this to be enyas best 'gothic' song to this day it 's almost like the darker side of heaven if you could call it that the song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song athair ar neamh is a very sad cloudy evening song that feature enya singing in gaelic this song is a very beautiful theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer the song end in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it go down from where i am is a beautiful piano instrumental china rose is a gorgeous breathtaking ambient song that made me get this album it 's one of enyas most stunning composition to date in my opinion china rose is a very romantic song that brings up image two lover walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaf falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of rose and a huge crystal castle in the background china rose is one of enyas most brilliant song to this day this song is the winner on the memory of tree hope ha a place is a another beautiful song that is similar to china rose although not quite a powerful or mind stimulating but still great this song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situation this song reminds me of how can i keep from singing from shepard moon tea house moon is one of the best enya instrumentals i have ever listened to it 's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground this song is one to enjoy when it 's cloudy and the red leaf are falling to the ground this song is one of my favorite off this cd once you had gold is one song that you probably should n't play if you have not had much sleep because it 's one song that will sooth your soul i fell asleep in class a few time in the past listening to this song giggle this song though is great though i enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening la sonadora is a very haunting song that feature enya singing in spanish this song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary a let 's say exile storm in africa or the dynamite na leatha geal m'oige but this song is one of the darker song off this album the chant remind me a bit of smaointe from a decade ago we brighten up again with the closing track on my way home this song that contains many element of the 1988 hit orinoco flow although not a spooky a that one this song is much brighter than orinoco and happier this song is like the predecessor to the brightness of a day without rain that followed this one five year later i consider this to be one of enyas strongest album to date only watermark surpasses this one and it 's not by too much i strongly recommend that all enya fan buy this amazing masterpiece it 's gorgeous and an album for the soul 

this is not another lousy celtic new age album it is a genuine piece of music well written and performed with emotion it never fails to send shiver up and down my spine for some reason ever since i heard orinoco flow enya ha cast her spell on me she is just so different and strange and so utterly artistic on this album every song is a perfect a it can get on a pop record with melody that have a tendency to lodge themselves into my brain i have every enya album to date but this one seems to be particularly special a must for any music lover 

many time and with good reason the new age label get slammed for lacking originality and conviction enya is not an artist who blend in with the rest and this release is in my opinion her best to date there is certainly an ethereal quality associated with new age and enya is certainly a new age artist but she ha strong writing skill and gorgeous and very unique voice that set her apart from her peer and if you look at what is being released these day many group are ripping off element of her uniqueness and plastering them on down tempo song with session singer who do an ok job of copying enya but do n't reach the depth of beauty and passion that only enya seems to find what make this a 5 star review for me is that the song work independently and even better a a cohesive set that keep you involved and feeling like you are living in an even better world than this one we know i know this sound ridiculous but take this review from someone who usually prefers an entirely different type of music al the song are great and although this cd can be great background music it work even better when it 's in the forefront of your attention because the production work is so masterful many artist fan are critical of the work that the producer brings to the table but i am always very appreciative when the final product doe not sound like it wa manufactured by an assembly line but rather reflects a balance of the artist 's intent with the listener in mind thanks for reading and i would like to thank all reviewer a their opinion even when i disagree give me clue a to what i may like and even more importantly provide exposure to artist who i may have missed if it were not for work also thanks to amazon com for providing this forum a i think that it clearly benefit the company but ultimately it also can be a great place for a potential buyer to find his or her next favorite cd 

i just recently purchased her ''paint the sky with stars'' cd and wa so impressed that i bought 3 of her previously released cd 's and plan to buy all her music she is truely talented and her music is very unique with a combination of modern classical and pop with a hint of an angelic tone i still recommend you buy this cd anybody who ha an appreciation for music will certainly enjoy her music 

over the past twenty odd year enya brennan ha become known worldwide for her layered vocal and delicate instrumentation in many way defining new age music but for her to have essentially taken the crown of this genre implies a depth to her music and this is very evident on the memory of tree enya 's first few album were good but there wa something missing something that had yet to be developed i'm not entirely sure what that intangible something wa but she certainly found it on this one the title track is an instrumental masterpiece featuring her trademark layered vocal though no lyric to speak of and it reminds on of a clear fall day this set the pace for the record which is decidedly autumnal 'anywhere is' is about the maze that life 's choice put u into while 'pax deorum' feature few lyric all in latin that reverberate almost like a dark stormy night that eventually settle into a calm drizzle 'once you had gold' is a delicate a a falling leaf and 'on my way home' brings back memory of weekend trip home from college traveling through the gorgeous foliage and dizzying scent of fall if 'only time' defined her a day without rain album it 's 'china roses' that defines the memory of tree enya ha crafted a lullaby like soothing piece of moonlight that is instantly calming it 's easily the best piece of the record and even nearly twenty year after the album 's release it still stand firmly refusing to sound dated in a genre that at one point relied a little too much on synthesizer it 's been over fifteen year since the memory of tree wa released but it 's a still favorite when it come to enya 's music a another reviewer said you ca n't go wrong with this artist but this album is definitely one of her best 

one cd with a running time of 44 minute ah this wonderful cd show off enya 's silky smooth voice the eleven tune are hauntingly beautiful i wo n't try to categorize her music it is simply too rich and complex the paperwork includes the word to ten of the song the memory of tree is a musical number and two nice color picture of enya i love extra so if you like enya 's past hit then i think that you will like this one a well buy it 

the problem with enya is that she is so consistently good it is difficult to write a review that say something different from previous review having recently reviewed a day without rain and previously watermark the same word ethereal ephemeral airy haunting and spiritual apply to each album the only risk is that my review become boring because enya could never be this cd begin with the instrumental track the memory of tree while the memory of tree is nominally an instrumental there are voice that punctuate portion of the music this opening feel optimistic though the title feel a though it is vaguely related to forest and land gone by the vocal provide a chorale sound that build and cascade around you with the feeling of great tree and landscape greater than any of the puny work of mankind great beast wander about and smaller beast enter and exit the brush at the edge of clearing in the great forest in a celebration of nature the pace speed up in the peppy anywhere is the lyric are poetic and symbolic and are a mirror maze of mental image a is frequently typical of enya the lyric seem to make sense until you attempt to understand them and then their meaning escape your grasp in this case the song seems to be describing the path we take in life and the choice that we make and whether they can be unmade and even whether the choice take u to or from the one we love another unusual feature of this song is the predominant instrument which compete for attention with enya 's voice typically enya 's voice stand out clearly from the instrument which in this case are mostly string and piano pax deorum is somewhat ominous and fit with the following song athair ar neamh both song are simple song that relate to god pax deorum translates roughly a the peace of the god or seeking to placate the god athair ar neamh translates approximately a father in heaven note that the title of the latter song appears a a line in the former song tying both song together and placing an irish gaelic line into a latin song there are moment of choral lightness in the otherwise ominous pax deorum which i believe ha appeared a the background music for a commercial the latter song is more contemplative and ethereal and enya allows the beauty of her voice to caress and harmonize the irish gaelic verse from where i am is a relatively sedate instrumental that form a brief piano interlude leading into china rose this song manages to capture the wonder of the universe and the beauty of heaven all in one song this song transcends the poetic to the surrealistic both lyrically and vocally once again enya allows her voice to be a beautiful instrument to complement the string and piano to create a work of aural art hope ha a place is the first song where the lyric are relatively easy to understand the concept is simple there is always hope where there is love the vocal are beautiful again and may remind a listener of the song enya wrote for the lord of the ring this song is for romantic and candle lit dinner everywhere another instrumental interlude follows tea house moon ha some of the most interesting instrumental effect on this cd the mood is contemplative and traditional though with a vaguely asian flavor this instrumental is the music for a heavenly choreography the next song change style again and yet fit within the character of the album once you had gold seems to allude to the transitory nature of all thing perhaps most particularly life there are line that seem to say that thing come and thing go and you need to accept the joy that you can get just from being here to greet the new day i particularly like the last line which say that there are no promise in life that there is good and bad and that one must make the best of any situation the song is sung in a fairy tale style a cautionary tale young and old the next song translates a the dreamer the music tell you all you need to know about the word which are surrealistic and of course dream like the ephemeral lyric and music bespeaks an atmosphere a feeling a place that can only exist in our dream though we might wish otherwise this song nearly achieves allowing u to be a creation of our imagination at last we must awaken from the fantasy enya ha woven for u on my way home return u to this place and time but with a longing for the place we leave the poetry that ha been woven for u yet we rejoice for we return to a place of familiarity and still there is the memory yes indeed the memory of tree 

if for some reason you 're interested in only a selection of the song herein the same recording of anywhere is china rose the memory of tree and on my way home have been collected on paint the sky with star enya composed all the music sang all the song and provided all the accompaniment rom ryan wrote the lyric nicky ryan helped with the arrangement and handled the engineering and mixing except where noted otherwise each song is sung in english enya is one of the best composer and performer i know to unwind with another in this category is ryan miller who composed the soundtrack for the video game myst and riven the memory of tree instrumental and voice no lyric waltz tempo opening with electronic keyboard joined by piano enya join in vocally but without word partway through the main theme is about six note long continually repeated with variation one of my two favourite on this cd ranked only after china rose anywhere is unusually staccato for enya mainly string accompaniment no percussion some piano the lyric are very distinct and easy to follow except during the chorus when the louder volume of the accompaniment and softer singing obscures the word a little you go there you 're gone forever i go there i 'll lose my way if we stay here we 're not together anywhere is pax deorum sung in latin noticeably deeper pitched chorus and accompaniment than usual the accompaniment includes some percussion in this case base drum although the beat is mainly carried by the keyboard athair ar neamh is sung in gaelic with very quiet keyboard accompaniment so that enya 's voice carry the main lyric very clearly during the chorus a multiple track arrangement wherein she appears to sing with herself blur the effect a little very clear and bell like on the whole from where i am instrumental only specifically piano a usual with enya her piano solo here make me think of water imagery china rose waltz tempo again opening with electronic keyboard but most of the accompaniment is covered by piano i know that if i have heaven there is nothing to desire rain and river a world of wonder may be paradise to me most of the verse contain a reference to heaven the night sky hope ha a place i would tentatively call this waltz tempo again but it 's very slow and the beat is n't quite regular enya 's singing come through very clearly herein except for the more complex chorus a usual the accompaniment consists of very simple chord on an electric keyboard so a not to drown out the singing the refrain is hope ha a place in a lover 's heart tea house moon instrumental unusually electronic feel to the keyboard carrying the melody in this one doe n't seem typical of enya 's work once you had gold 'once you had silver then came the rain out of the blue ever and always always and ever with the refrain time gave both darkness and dream to you waltz tempo again almost a lullaby in this instance enya 's singing dominating the piano and keyboard accompaniment with a wordless chorus la sonadora sung in spanish very drowsily waltz tempo again the quiet accompaniment is primarily voice with some very deep string with organ joining in after a couple of verse on my way home open with organ accompaniment a in the later part of the previous song but then switch to a very staccato keyboard accompanying enya 's singing on my way home i remember only good day 

released five year after 'shepherd moons' during which 'the celts' had been re released 'the memory of trees' wa much anticipated by fan of enya and turned out to be only slightly le impressive than the previous two album the christmassy lead single 'anywhere is' set the tone excellently an extremely simple and addictive tune repeated constantly it wa fun and not at all serious the rest of the album seemed a reflection of this and a with 'watermark' it wa a generally cheery collection still despite an excellent set of opening song the album seemed to bog down into too many ballad towards the end 'la sonadora' although introducing spanish to enya 's vocabulary went on and on and on despite the presence of the rousing 'on my way home' a a closing song the title track seemed uncomfortably close to being a cliche too despite all that it wa business a before the production seemed more earthy and le ethereal and 'on my way home' wa the closest thing to a mainstream single enya ha ever done 

she is one of a kind and this album only enhances her contribution to musical enjoyment a always the instrumental opening set a mood followed by the lively anywhere is a song which grew on me each time i listened each song is exquisite but for me china rose is the most delicately crafted song however once you had gold which is n't mentioned a much is another of the highpoints on my way home is a fitting conclusion to the album i have heard rumor that not everybody like enya and if there is a person who doe n't like her then he or she should n't get this cd but for everybody else this is one of the essential cd 's for your collection 

what an enchanting collection this is i fell in love with enya 's music right from her first hit `orinocco flow' and have been a fan ever since enya 's haunting and ethereal voice coupled with rich magical musical arrangement layered dreamy sounding backing vocal and lyric sung in english latin and gaelic set her aside form all other new age artist opening track `memory of trees' is a beautiful instrumental with angelic voice flitting in and out `anywhere is' ha an upbeat tempo cutting string lush instrumentation and poetic lyric `tea house moon' is an instrumental with a chinese sound magical keyboard i think set against a delicate backdrop beautiful just a delicate is `la so ntilde adora' with very ethereal vocal against a gently brooding soundscape then there 's the tender piano instrumental `from where i am' `pax deorum' sung in latin will have you checking to see you 're not in a monastery very religious sounding the absolute standout ha got to be `athair ar nearmh' sung in gaelic this song is stunning angelic vocal delicate piano with delicate string sweeping in and out mournful sounding but outstanding a magical delicate angelic experience 

enya the memory of tree 1995 in certain circle such a my profession massage therapy enya is ubiquitous people tend to get really tired of hearing her all the time e o enya overdose can be an unpleasant almost sickly experience aside from that i think some people are just jealous of her enormous popularity i just learned that her day without rain cd which came out in 2000 wa the 16th highest seller of the last decade but she 's wildly popular for good reason one could say her music is synthesized plastic but it 's beautiful soothing plastic what 's not plastic is enya 's sweet melodic voice at least i hope it 's not plastic i sincerely doubt she us auto tune enya 's been accused of being soulless harsh but sometimes you 'd rather hear something calming pleasant and pretty instead of some gut wrenching aretha franklin or janis joplin weeper would n't you the following is a song by song breakdown of the album to give reader an idea of which track they might like to sample before getting the whole album the memory of tree a majestic cinematic opener no lyric it serf a a wonderful prelude anywhere is i know some people like this one but i find it unbearable to me it 's too cloying sing songy and flat out dorky it 's just too jaunty for my taste i'm forced to program the song on my cd player whenever i want to hear this album because i refuse to listen to this one and of course i program only certain song from this album for massage i wa shocked to see it on enya 's greatest hit collection pax deorum quite different than anything else here this track ha an ominous pulsing sound which make me think of impending war in some medieval or lord of the ring setting enya chant most of the word sung in gallic in a low register i never use it for massage but it 's an interesting track if yer in the mood for it 1 2 athair ar neamh another one sung in gallic this soft restrained song is one of the most beautiful on the album from where i am is a short instrumental with only piano and some very subtle atmospheric touch a sweet melody china rose possibly enya 's best song ever sound like floating through heaven magical hope ha a place a gentle song about love 1 2 tea house moon a pretty instrumental vaguely oriental once you had gold another soft sweet song with a gorgeous melody 1 2 la sonadora is a subtle slightly somber track sung in spanish on my way home begin with some rolling old school synth sound reminiscent of her first album and soon burst with bright energy a fitting finale 

enya ha one of the most beautiful voice of this day her voice is fitting for the style of music she sings clear a a bell her voice is airy and light a she sings in english latin or gaelic there is a lot of power in her voice the music she chooses support her voice appropriately and add to her sound she ha the ability to conjure up image with each note she sings like all of her previous album this one is again excellent there are a many great song on this album china rose ha that airy sound that enya is well known for she sings the backing vocal a an arpeggio of three long note of just her voice over it she sings the lyric of the song in her crisp tone almost like a crystal bell ringing the latin sounding pax deorum ha a medieval sound to it again she utilizes her voice singing in the background to add counterpoint to the lyric anywhere is sound like the perfect single for the album much more upbeat than the other song it ha a very staccato feel making it a very energetic song on the opposite end of the spectrum is hope ha a place here her voice ha a very haunting quality to it made even more so with the organ playing behind her it is a very beautiful song i'm amazed at how enya can keep making new album that sound similar to her previous one yet be totally new for the listener a well her voice is aging well and she seems to improve with each passing album i hope to hear much more from her in the future a there is always room in my collection for her beautiful voice 

remember when you were but a small child and when you had trouble falling asleep your parent would come and bring you into a lull with nursery rhyme in short that 's what the memory of tree is a collection of sweet and hushed song designed to put one at ease and carry them into a peaceful sleep now one would think that since the title of the album deal with tree the whole work itself would have an environmental theme to each of it song but it doe not enya started this cycle when her debut album the celt featured celtic chant and jig her second album watermark had a collection of water themed song and her third album shepherd moon had song that dealt with a world beyond this one actually the memory of tree doe a very nice job of breaking this cycle because there are only a few song that deal with anything related to tree or the environment and all of them are highlight of the album these include the memory of tree which is the opening track and one of her best song ever composed china rose a beautifully crafted pastorale and la sonadora a descriptive narration of dream of landscape this album is probably one of the few enya collection that have 3 instrumental track all of which are very nice transition to each section of the album i do not advise you to play the album in it entirety in your car because you will surely fall asleep true that 's the greatest strength of the album but also it fatal weakness if you manage to stay awake through all eleven lullaby your purchase wa very well worth it 

enya is in a class all by herself she envokes feeling and image that take you out of reality so many others have copied her sound ala james horner in titanic that it 's easy to see how much of an influence she ha been quot the memory of tree quot is a classic album from the emotional first track instrumental to the enchanting quot on my way home quot enya ha created a pallete of wonderful pastime and tragic metaphores here yes i would consider this pop new age music and there 's nothing wrong with that there are a number of people that do n't like enya there are joke on south park about her and that 's good it show how much of a musical force she is quot the memory of tree quot is a good collection of material from a very important artist who i hope will never give up her love of music 

the memory of tree begin with the stunning titletrack a great mix of voice and instrumental sound this is one of enya 's best song anywhere is ha a great rythm and is catchy pax deorum is a latin song and very haunting it 's like you 're in a storm finding a place to schelter the fourth song is athair ar neamh it 's sung in gaelic i think i see that it mean quot father in heaven quot thank you other amazon reviewer from where i am is an instrumental track and it sort of lull you to sleep then there is china rose a very romantic song about a dreamlike world a sort of dream i think hope ha a place is another highlight of this record just great lyric and a soothing atmosphere thea house moon is another instrumental track it 's not my favourite track but still good track number nine is once you had gold listen carefully to the lyric again just magic la sonadora is a spooky ballad sung in spanish i do n't know but another highlight of the memory of tree and then there is the final track on my way home on paint the sky with star the best of enya you can hear the edited version this one is longer and much more beautiful a great ending to one of the best cd 's ever made 

in 1994 the r b market wa cluttered with girl group in the like of swv xscape tlc en vogue zhane and jade despite stiff competition changing face a duo of new york songstress attained commerical success with their self titled debut this wa due mainly to the superb lead single stroke u up platinum single sale and the follow up foolin' around each produced by r kelly in addition both singer were capable vocalist a displayed by interchangeable lead throughout the set not only were the single well crafted but the rest of the album held it own a well other highlight include keep it right there remix featured on white 's man burden come closer smooth production and smoky vocal baby your love midtempo treat 2nd favorite track good thing late night sleeper and all is not gone syrupy ballad favorite track in sum changing face turned out an excellent record in the midst of the cluttered girl group market even though their debut wa commercially successful better record would later turn up for changing face namely their 3rd set despite not acheiving the accompanying sale however this record is still very good it ha aged well and continues to get spin from me and radio a good buy for the avid r b follower grade b 

this is the type and caliber of album that is sadly missing from today pathetic music scene foolin'around became an instant classic good thing is a painfully true song and all is not gone is a beautiful hope instilling track the entire album is good but these three song are the cream of the crop i miss the day when woman such a these were appreciated for creating thought provoking beautifully sung ballad instead of being lauded for marketing sex appeal oh well i can always pop this gem into my player whenever i'm craving quality musical offering a it is i'm going to be playing the surfacing off of this disc in the following week 

in 1994 r kelly introduced u to cassandra lucas and charisse rose better known a changing face their very first single stroke you up had men everywhere saying yes you can then came foolin' around and with song like that already out people were wondering when the album wa coming out this album give you a taste of solid r b silky ballad like the two aforementioned track are accompanied by song like come closer and keep it right there a well a the two best track thought of you and all is not gone not one song here is fast forwardable the only problem i could really see with this album is the lack of varied subject matter for example there are four kick your man to the curb song foolin' around am i wasting my time movin' on and good thing still this album is a very good listen way to go lady 

these woman are good this entire cd is good they did a pretty good job for a debut album from what i know they are best friend i am still enjoying this album this is a good album and they are many good song on this album my favorite are keep it right there foolin around and of course stroke you up by r kelly 

omg sound even better that when they first came out with this cd i love these girl they have beautiful voice sure wish the would have continued their career in singing ordid they and i am not updated enough to know of this i still love this cd 

some track on this cd are really great of course their big hit quot stroke you up quot but their are also a few more song on here that really great mainly quot foolin' around quot witch imo is the best song on the cd i also like te song quot keep it right there quot 

this record wa so slept on with the exception of the hit quot stroke you up quot feat r kelly the only reason i could think of is the flooded r amp b market because first off they can sing there attractive and the musical content and song idea r strong this came out in 94 and i can say nothing better ha came out since not even changin face 2nd album thats why 6 year later this still get much play there isnt a song on here i dont like everything on here is tight the only record that can even compete with this is michel'e quot michel'e quot keith sweat quot make it last forever quot guy quot the future quot and mary j blige quot what's the 411 this record should get a ten but amazon will only let me give 5 i have reviewed a lot of record and few have gotten 5's but this this is a 5 so if you hav'nt heard this get it if you had it and lost it find it or buy a new one like i have 3 time 

in high school stroke you up wa the jam so i went downtown and bought the cassette let me tell you something it took me 2 day to listen to it because it wa utterly boring even stroke you up became unbearable to listen to no funk no groove just lukewarm soul that wa the first and the last time i listened to changing face the two chick who made up changing face had airy monotonous vocal no edge to their voice at all even the album cover looked boring these chick had no style or any type of pizzazz at all skip this at all cost and get zhane 

this cd wa pretty good when it came out the only hit that i can remember wa the joint with r kelly talking about can i stroke you up anyway it 's ok i would not suggest purchasing it though download the song on itunes and save your money neosoul06 

i first bought the cd single of stroke you up back in '94 and the tape when it came out and i wore the tape out until it broke on me the album is the best and one of the best album among the girl group of the mid 90 's and were criticized heavily by a lot of people because of one time when they were video soul it sounded like there were lip synching and were labeled a studio singer no matter what this group could sing to me and had a string of three very good hit the first two single were stroke you up foolin' around which were produced by r kelly and the third single wa my favorite of the album keep it right there which had the urban touch and produced by one of my favorite producer devante some other highlight on the album wa feeling all this love movin on thought of you baby your love produced by heavy d overall this is a great album with a great soultry mix this group may not have been in the class of envogue jade a far a vocal but they can still hold their own 

this album wa released during an era where slow jam were in and giving up tempo r b flavor a try wa also in like many of their counterpart during that time the pretty lady of changing face needed to realize their strength in ballad and avoided trying any up tempo material however there are a couple of good tune on this album particularly the slow jam all is not gone where sorrow and regret serf a a theme for a song that wa definitely written with the intent of winning over one with heartbreak in their history r kelly produced hit stroke you up wa a radio smash but the lyric were n't exactly poetic or articulate but it 's still a popular track that may bring back some old school nostalgia for some of you 

changing faces' recording career wa off to a good start with this self titled debut album the name changing face alluded to changing trend in 1990s r b which wa moving away from new jack swing and toward a softer type of medium tempo groove in fact pretty much everything on this cd favor a medium tempo sound the new york duo doe n't overwhelm the listener with either slow ballad or fast material cassandra lucas and charisse rose collectively changing face are strong singer and while slow jam like thought of you movin' on and come closer are n't mind blowing they 're pleasant enough not surprisingly foolin' around and stroke you up both written and produced by r kelly became major hit 

a lot of people did n't know about this cd when it came out this wa and still is a great buy the singing is priceless 

the first album of this girl duo with the r kelly hit quot stroke you up quot andothers it 's a solid typical r kelly production with fine voice verybeautiful ballad quot all is not gone 

this is jus a good r and b album that still sound good on 9 11 09 i already heard foolin around stroke u up keep it right there and now i am finally listening to more from changing face all of the song are so consistant and flow 2gether in that loving good vibe way the sound of the early 90 's are precious i luv the song am i wasting my time i only wish i could find the remix for feeling all this luv i bought the cd for that song but it 's jus the album cut i had it on the cassette single for foolin around every song on here is gr8 no skip over get this baby i got this 

the band 's first album remains in my eye the best the songwriting and production are top notch and although the lyric are typically oblique quot you get the diplomatic treatment you get the force fed future quot the song are performed and sung with such skill that you tend not to notice an excellent combination of various style post punk new wave power pop it say a lot that both classic rock radio and alternative radio lay claim to the car my favorite are quot bye bye love quot quot just what i needed quot and quot all mixed up quot but even song i did n't particularly like quot i'm in touch with your world quot have grown on me an excellent recording for any pop or rock fan 

this is one of those very special album now cd 's that can be counted on to always generate a happy smile to my face i saw the car dig this it should be the other way around huh open for foreigner in '78 for reason that are not relevant here i have to admit that that concert experience wa right up there with seeing ian hunter up close or seeing the stone in '75 well my band already did just what i needed which wa difficult to perform without that all important synth line still on one of the very greatest night of my life my best friend guitarist and our lady singer decided that they had had enough of my pain my angst whatever due to a divorce earlier that year i wa at work at a most ostentatious clothing store and i would n't get off till 9 30 but regardless i received a phone call from kent telling me he and the lady had broken into my apartment where did i hide the g ja and to find y 'self a date there we 're takin' you out dancin' we 're tired of you whinin' all the time i did the beautiful red headed lady security person agreed and to make a long story short er i got up for a second and when i returned the band wa just finishing segar 's sunspot baby the beautiful security lady sat there with a delicious come hither look about her we danced and yes baby segued right in to fire down below a more appropriate song wa never written but a to say this is yo' nite chaz turner the band concluded with the cars' most ethereal let the good time roll a i wrote in a paper for a psych 101 class a couple of year later i wo n't embellish the story with pornographic detail but be that a it may we all wound up at my apartment about 4 30am played a little music had a drink and a smoke and sort of paired off yes and the good time did indeed roll two thing a anything you may have heard about redhead is undeniably 100 truthful i mean that in the most positive loving way b and i can certainly understand whenever keef is interviewed about the current state of rock and roll he always reply the 'rock ' gimme the roll yeah brother 

for the most part the car were a single band but their debut stand a one of the best ever new wave album the hit song were solid including the amazing threesome quot let the good time roll quot quot my best friend 's girl quot and quot just what i needed quot that kick off the album but side two is were the car demonstrate their artistic complexity particularly on the lengthy double track quot moving in stereo all mixed up quot quot you 're all i 've got tonight quot and quot bye bye love quot make for another couple of great single a well this album is so good it could stand a a greatest hit package all on it own 

many band have a long time to perfect the song for their first album resulting in a solid debut this may be the case for the car although candy o is great too this album contains classic song like just what i needed you 're all i 've got tonight bye bye love and moving in stereo it 's a crime that this band never got the credit they deserved they created catchy sometimes quirky rock song with a good balance between rockin guitar and cool keyboard elliot easton 's guitar playing is superb a he always play for the song and not just to show off the vocal phrasing of ric ocasek and ben orr rest in peace is excellent even if i did n't always understand the lyric a classic album that must never be forgotten 

i love this band i love how they infused the synthesizer into much of their music to me the sound come across the way i like it raw ocasek and orr compliment each other well switching lead vocal my favs are quot just what i needed quot quot moving in stereo quot if any of you remember the movie quot fast time at ridgemont high quot there is a killer scene with phoebe cates and the car quot moving in stereo quot i highly recommend this cd 

i originally had the car debut on 8track twenty something year ago the tape pulled out remember how 8 track did that so i bought the record album after playing it soooo many time i wa able to see through it i went and bought the cassette needle to say i wore it out too i now have the cd and am trying my hardest to wear it out the format may wear out but great tune never die i must have listened to the car debut album over a thousand time it 's still great a classic among classic 

forget greatest hit just listen to this and you 'll be reminded what got you hooked on the car in the first place this album in my opinion this release is their greatest a stunning debut 

there are certain recording that become part of the audio landscape this wa one of them if ever there wa a band that defined americana in the '80s it wa the car and like so many or our aging and posthemous hero they passed into lore i think the most enduring test of the greatness of this record is to play against what 's spinning these day and it will still sound a fresh a the day a these boston boy cranked it out do n't ya stop do n't ya stop 

i loved the car soooo oringinal the more time pass the better they are and this is the set of song that launched the legendary band 

what can i say about the car first album the car debut album ha to be one of the most impressive album that i have ever heard why ca n't band make album this great anymore three big hit single good time roll just what i needed and my bestfriend 's girl a well a bye bye love moving in stereo and you 're all i 've got tonight that each get a lot of radio play a well this is one of those rare album that is great from start to finish no filler here 

the music magazine q recently compiled a list of the 100 best debut album ever the car 's debut wa not on that list it wa however on the top 10 debut we love to hate list from my standpoint they were in good company among artist such a queen dire strait and boston being a british magazine q may have simply missed the influence this album generated since it wa n't that big in the uk 29 my best friend 's girl 3 became a major hit but in great part due to the single being among the first single if not the very first released a a picture disc shaped like a car just what i needed 17 barely crawled into the top 20 and that wa practically it for the car until they stroke gold internationally with song from their heartbeat city album in the state this album would hardly be treated similar compilation my best friend 's girl 27 just what i needed 35 good time roll 41 became radio staple and really much more popular than their billboard top 100 ranking indicate during it release it wa still common on late night radio show to play whole side the three song already being hit on side a side b became a popular choice for such occasion the album did n't set the chart on fire barely sneaking in the top 20 18 with continuous airplay of many of the album 's track sale were consistent which in the state matter much more than in most other territory it wound up being among the top 30 seller of the decade selling 6 million copy an incredible achievement for an album not even close to cracking the top 10 the car both band and album thus became huge in the state there are a few thing special about this album at the time of it release 1978 it producer roy thomas baker wa in huge demand mainly due to his work with queen with queen the production wa full of sound effect and bombastic vocalization bohemian rhapsody is a prime example the production on the car is however sparse on most of the album the intro of my best friend 's girl and just what i needed are especially good example this made the use of synthesiser more prominent in a sense the text were filled with ric ocasek 's irony which he delivered in a dead panned way along with the late benjamin orr 's more emotional approach in singing in between this sparse production came forceful harmony e g on you 're all i 've got tonight and good time roll combined this gave the car a punkish feel what today would be labelled a post punk rock this sounded very fresh from the typical rock sound which at that point dominated the airwave a some kind of alternative to balance the popularity of disco actually it is remarkable how fresh the music still sound today more than 25 year after it release many group today are basically doing similar thing but now it is viewed a being retro there is however one major drawback on buying this cd meaning 4 instead of 5 star the sound quality is below par which becomes more evident listening to their just what i needed anthology despite being 10 year old the re mastering job on that release draw forth the sloppy transfer to cd the sound is very low although not being muddled a many other badly transferred record this album really could use some re mastering there is one available a deluxe version from 1990 with an extra demo disc there have however been many album re mastered originally released later with clearly audible result so that version doe not cut it in my book given the sonic achievement that have been done with old queen release the recent 30th anniversary edition of a night at the opera could have been recorded yesterday this album should have tremendous potential in being a major re release not only would a re mastering job be welcome but a hybrid sacd version would have the potential of making these classic fresher than ever ric are you reading this 

the car made a distinct and lasting impression by creating an incredibly unique sound which wa post disco and pre hard rockin' 80 's and defies any traditional music classification this is quite simply one of the top 15 rock album of all time period 

comeon an albumthis great no one is going to read all the accurate 5 star review would you me either list the 8 great debute album and this will be listed on most i wonder what universe this would not be considered great not a universe i would want to be in if you really need to be convinced read all the 5 star review 

all track are perfect great music this is a must album with such iconic hit seems like they never get old 

the car is their self titled debut and one of the great album of the new wave era although their album heartbeat city had more hit and sold more copy the track here are their best work and many of them still get consistent airplay on classic rock radio the catchy hook and memorable melody still sound amazingly fresh over 25 year later making the car one of the few new wave act whose work ha truly stood the test of time like boston 's self titled debut album which appeared 2 year earlier this play like a greatest hit album the first three track quot good time roll quot quot my best friend 's girl quot and quot just what i needed quot were all big hit and are now bonafide new wave classic although not a big hit quot you 're all i 've got tonight quot with it simple yet memorable riff and david robinson 's busy drumming remains one of their most enduring track other excellent track include the punk pop of quot do n't cha stop quot the hypnotic quot moving in stereo quot the moody quot all mixed up quot and the catchy quot bye bye love quot the band 's ability to play to the strength of the song is admirable here whether it 's guitarist elliot easton 's excellent lead work on quot you 're all i 've got tonight quot greg hawkes' keyboard flourish on quot i'm in touch with your world quot or ric ocasek and ben orr 's strong vocal throughout the album an excellent debut highly recommended 

in my view this album by itself represents the birth of new wave that is before it had a name when the car released this their first there simply wa no other sound like it and it would take year before other artist even came close to reproducing the cool beat laden tech heavy resonance of such song a good time roll my best friend 's girl just what i needed you 're all i 've got tonight and the terrific combination of moving in stereo and all mixed up in short mock all you want the haircut and vapid lyric of the boy band which came later but this one is real hard and a original a it get 

the car wa one of the most original band to come out of the late 70 early 80 a band that helped set the yardstick for new wave this wa their first album coming out in 1978 and is in my humble opinion to be the best album that the band cut just about all of it track are great and not just the hit just what i needed my best friend 's girl and good time roll if you are a fan of new wave music then you will love this album heck even if is just that you fondly remember the music of the late 70 early 80 then you will love this album too do yourself a favor and buy this album 

just what i needed wa already an oldie by the time i wa a high school sophomore but that did n't stop it from being one of the most relevant song i could get my hand on it simultaneously fulfilled all of my most pertinent musical craving serving up a flawless three and a half minute cocktail of crunching power chord heroic sharp melodic hook hopelessly clever lyric and vocal that were both quirky and impassioned it wa the perfect pop song but with enough spiky alt new wave attitude to imbue it with a sense of genuine cool every time i cue it up it take me back to tenth grade to that joyful year that saw me fall helplessly in love with my best friend just what i needed is the sound of pure hopeless joy of butterfly in the stomach and lightness in the head of wry knowing angst and cheekily self deprecating humor it 's the sound of smart people letting their emotion sneak up on them beautiful but the most mind boggling thing about just what i needed is that it 's not even my favorite song here that honor would probably go to bye bye love which is a brittle cynical masterpiece it 's a simple breakup song that somehow manages to turn the whole notion of love inside out and every one of it hook is stuffed with bitterness and paranoia and caustic wit in fact i 'd say that this album is worth the price of admission purely on the basis of ric ocasek sneering you think you 're so illustrious you call yourself intense it 's one of the most withering putdowns in the history of pop music rivaling even the more acidic moment of this year 's model and highway 61 revisited the other seven song are icing on the cake i love icing there are sweet gooey gob of it all over this disc in the form of such irresistible classic a my best friend 's girl and do n't cha stop i'm in touch with your world is marvelously quirky and moving in stereo is endearingly creepy you 're all i 've got tonight is desperate and paranoid and surprisingly fun good time roll is a panicked anti party anthem and all mixed up is really atmospheric and kinda sultry and the chorus is beautiful sort of yeah this album 'll blow your mind with it inescapable wonderfulness treat yourself to it 

the car hit a formula right from the very start with ric ocasek generally taking the lead vocal the car combined wonderfully wordsmithed lyric with a solid rock beat to become one of the best new wave group some people have argued that the car along with devo and several other group created new wave this album is a remarkable debut with three of the song released a single and three others released a flipsides for a incredible 6 of 9 song appearing a single something that few other group have managed to achieve the song are just what i needed i'm in touch with your world 5 29 78 best friend 's girl do n't cha stop 10 10 78 and good time roll all mixed up 2 27 79 i 've always had a great appreciation for the cars' lyric they are typically artfully evocative and more intended to evoke emotion than to convey a concept directly a an example look at the opening lyric of all mixed up she shadow me in the mirrorshe never leaf on the lightand some thing that i say to herthey just do n't seem to bitewhen you read the cars' typically ric ocasek 's lyric you feel surrealistic once you understand you are to picture image of feeling or feel the feeling yourself you gain an understanding of how the singer songwriter is feeling the car insisted they are music performer and not an act preferring to be known for their music rather than their ability to look flashy or jump around on stage fortunately for u the listener that desire translates into musical quality and sincerity this music ha a pop feel to it but with enough of a hard edge that push it towards the boundary between pop and hard rock the musical style is somewhat dated feeling like the late 70 music that it is but it ha aged to the point where it is now classic rock this cd is very solid music for anyone a fan of the car of late 70 or 80 music or anyone looking for something a bit out of the mainstream that ha a good solid rock beat 

it 's ridiculous how many band nowadays blatantly rip off the car without anyone calling them on their crap stacy 's mom anyone weezer or hot hot heat perhaps the reason for all of this idolatry is of course because the cars' debut album is still one of the freshest and most vital pop album ever the record wa released in 1978 and it never cease to amaze me with just how timelessly perfect it still sound with simple catchy and infinitely memorable song the cars' debut is the official soundtrack to a good time easily one of the 70s' best just what i needed is among my top five favorite pop song ever 

strong debut for the boston post punk new wave band fronted by the legendary ric ocasek though bassist benjamin orr could almost be considered a co frontman snide charm and effortless hook dominated this effort with several deserved hit along the way and at least a couple more that probably could have been smash a well heavily influenced and influential it flavor is dulled a bit by time their fusion of punk new wave with catchy hard rock is no longer quite a new just what i needed is of course the standout of the bunch but the underrated minor hit you 're all i 've got tonight is nearly it equal meanwhile the hit track my best friend 's girl ha n't aged quite a well but it 's got such a goofily fun hook that it 's nearly irresistible surprisingly one of the weakest track i'm in touch with your world is the one that work hardest to stand apart unfortunately it fall victim to a weak melody and the clich eacute s of punchy psychedelia best cut just what i needed you 're all i 've got tonight good time roll moving in stereo do n't cha stop my best friend 's girl all mixed up 

for many listener it might be hard at this point to listen to the cars' 1978 debut album with fresh ear over half the song here remain staple of classic rock radio station and even if you do n't voluntarily listen to these station you 're bound to be familiar with song like just what i needed good time roll etc even so this is a great album well deserved of it classic status do n't be fooled by the cars' tendency to get pegged a a 'singles band' this nine song debut actually ha the feel of a song cycle with it uncannily sequenced lineup of song one of the great appeal of ric ocasek is the playful yet classy and savagely witty way in which he wrote about sex how there 's so much more to it than just 'getting laid' there 's a certain desperation mixed with vulnerability in song like just what i needed and you 're all i 've got tonight the opening good time roll set the scene perfectly with ric offering u a feel good anthem fed through his own warped sensibility my best friend 's girl is a wonderfully entertaining 'modernization' of buddy holly 's patented sound do n't 'cha stop with it pleasant valley sunday ish opening riff is album 's sole uptempo track the chorus feel rather tossed off but it 's still a very fine track with great layered guitar line on the verse the i ca n't explain esque bye bye love ha a very upbeat sounding tune but the ominous lyric and ben orr 's marvelously stylish vocal delivery help make it the perfect lead in to the album 's final two track moving in stereo wa cooked up by ric and greg hawkes in ric 's basement making it the one track on the album ric did n't write on his own and what a classic it is david robinson 's drum are tweaked a bit giving them a noticeably brash quality hawkes offer a synth line that 's creepy and defiant without sounding melodramatic perfect vocal from ben orr could this man ever sing all mixed up end the album in cathartic fashion great dynamic sumptuous vocal harmony and a stirringly emotional climax with a brilliantly placed keyboard lick from hawkes and ben orr once again working magic with his powerful commanding vocal i also must not fail to mention i'm in touch with your world another 'hidden' gem contained herein it show that ric could wring a quirky chord progression out of his guitar if he really tried ric delivers an ultra edgy lead vocal it ha a great bug under your skin quality to it and all the percussion sudden blast of sound effect and 'tick tock' synths on the chorus punctuate this mostly stripped down track marvelously lead guitarist elliot easton is n't spotlighted a much a he would be on the subsequent candy o but you can hear how the man wa a big believer in 'serving the songs' check out his well placed rockabilly lick instantly reminiscent of the beatles' i will on my best friend 's girl or his fine if rather brief solo on just what i needed so you may think you know this album all too well already but i suggest perhaps there 's a bit more to this than you realize after all with a group like the car thing are often not a they seem 

these remark are aboutasin b0000262u4'the cars' import cd on the warner bros uk label you already know whether you like the cars' debut album but there are many cd pressing out there and many of them sound awful this one sound great without the heavy handed compression eq and brickwall limiting of so many 'remastered' disc this sound like the original vinyl if you want this album on cd this cdis the one you want 

the car released this great record back in 1978 shortly after it s release it wa all over the airwave this album is in my opinion another one of the finest debut album in rock ever there are so many great song on this album it may well be the car quintessential album ric ocasek rythm guitarist and chief song writer for the car wa in top form on this album for me the best cut are and there are many you re all i ve got tonight good time roll bye bye love moving in stereo just what i needed my best friend s girl all mixed up and don t cha stop i realize i have just named most of the tune on this album but i think this album is a must for any car fan new or old i also love the cover that chick with the sexy red lip this album and their second album candy o from 1979 are two of the best album the car ever did 

this 1978 blend of tuneful pop and power rock ha stood the test of time very well the album contains a magical fusion of the melodicism of pop and the passionate force of rock the first three track good time roll my best friend 's girl and just what i needed form one of those legendary song cycle just like the sequence of dirty as rock amp roll darling i need you and rollaroll on john cale 's slow dazzle album but every one of the track is excellent made timeless by their killer hook tight harmony and focused energy to my mind the car continued the poprock tradition of artist like queen alice kooper and roxy music whilst there is also a specifically new wave feel about this album that reminds me of an obscure contemporary of theirs one mink deville and of course those other famous poprockers blondie of course pat benatar and the knack mined a similar vein but they came later all of the song were written by ric ocasek no mean feat considering their gripping melodic appeal and lasting popularity on the playlist this album is one of the best example of late 70 style rock with a punk attitude 

learning to drive wa one of the most liberating experience i have had it just changed the rule of the game i went from being a kid who had to be shuttled around to a more active participant in the world at large i not only had a new lease on life but also new responsibility a 1990 honda civic to take care of my parents' old car that became mine around 1995 or so that felt adult like i think i grew a lot overall from the experience and now many year later ca n't imagine what life would be like if i could n't get behind the wheel i 've always associated driving with liberation and excitement and to this day it 's my best place to think i have logged a lot of mile on several vehicle over the year and wait i'm reviewing something are n't i can think of no better soundtrack for this experience than the first car album this album wa released the year after i wa born so i certainly did n't grow up with it through my formative read teenage year like some of the other reviewer here however i 've always felt a certain kinship with this little classic a if it 's something that i should in italic have grown up with perhaps that 's because for all of it virtue a lot of the music that came about in my era wa n't particularly fun and catchy driving to nirvana or soundgarden is imho a soup sandwich unless you 're really angry and or depressed the closest corollary is teenage fanclub another band that ha created some of my favorite driving music fountain of wayne of course and canadian band sloan the cars' first disc is the driving album that every generation ought to have full of good poppy rockin fun with an ever so slightly twisted perspective arched eyebrow at the ready that allows you to still feel smart while singing along i could n't ask for more however absent any discovery yet to be made i do n't believe there is such a thing for gen x and beyond in the meantime give this a spin the next time you head out on the road and try to picture that rush of liberation that you may have experienced when you first got behind the wheel unsupervised it 's a nice feeling 

i got this album on vinyl when it came out in the 70 every song good and i think their best album one of the first new wave album but also retro at the same time get it you already know most of the song 

for those of u coming of age in the late 70 and the 80 this album is one of a handful that capture the time forget about all the new wave reference what the hell is new wave anyway song for song this is a killer album that define a sound but also transcend it to be a great album about love for any decade the lyric the crafty cool rock the band persona are all classic 

the band ric ocasek vocal rhythm guitar elliot easton lead guitar benjamin orr vocal bass greg hawkes keyboard percussion saxophone david robinson drum percussion the disc 1978 9 track clocking in at just over 35 minute included with the disc is a minimal 2 page foldout containing song title time band member and original black white photo artwork digitally remastered in 1990 there is a deluxe remastered 2 disc disc 2 is all demo edition released in 1999 label elektra comment the car were never better than this debut album rock and pop with a synth techno alternative flavor classic song that sounded like nothing else at the time the car were new wave before there wa new wave which hit in the early 80 's 9 song with only one question mark filler in i'm in touch with your world the other 8 track were gold the album reached 18 on the billboard pop chart and ha sold over 6 million unit ric ocasek 's quirky voice teamed with bassist ben orr 's smooth voice worked well together greg hawke on keyboard made pulled this band tighter the song that made it to major air wave were let the good time roll my best friend 's girl and just what i needed but check out track 6 9 you 're all i 've got tonight bye bye love moving in stereo and all mixed up run together fluidly these are awesome album track sure this band looked like a bunch of geek but man when they came together with their instrument they really made some beautiful music only their 2nd album candy o came close but no album of the car wa better than this one this debut is ranked 282 on rolling stone magazine 's list of 500 all time greatest album r i p benjamin orr 10 3 00 classic disc 5 star 

the car 1978 is the the cars' greatest work ever sure '80 's top 40 pop enthusiast would probably say that about heartbeat city which did sell more record upon release but real rock fan rate their debut at the top why because just like most great rock debut such a boston and van halen it show the car in hungry mode pulling out all the stop to create a hard edgy and energetic record that wa different from anything else out at the time this band combined hard guitar rock with a spacey keyboard driven new wave sound that only then wa beginning to emerge in equal amount with straightforward simple lyric and created a sound that wa raw yet sleek edgy but commercially accessible and totally fresh at that time between ric ocasek and benjamin orr 's similarly cool unaffected lead vocal greg hawkes' incredibly cool futuristic keyboard and elliot easton 's slicing awesome guitar work this album wa truly unique it influenced countless other new wave rock band afterwards it ha since stood the test of time and that 's what make it a true classic when i first heard the car on a cassette tape 22 year ago i wa already quite familiar with quot just what i needed quot then i really got hooked on quot good time roll quot and quot best friend 's girl quot it wa n't until 1982 that i really started liking quot you 're all i 've got tonight quot and quot bye bye love quot the following year i got into quot i'm in touch with your world quot but it ha only been in the past couple of year that i have totally fallen for the medley of quot moving in stereo all mixed up quot talk about a true classic over the year every now and then it 's given me something new to love about it most recommended 

the car are an extremely talented aor band fronted by ric ocasek this band is very good just like pink floyd cream the rolling stone ac dc and queen their debut is their best pick it up right away but ignore the previous reviewer and his lousy recmmendations 

watershed car album the only one you need youve heard 'em all worth it mostly for the usually not aired moving in stereo a moody cryptic slow rocker and doncha stop i ca n't say what it 's about here but you may be able to get yr head around it if you listen carefully 

every track on this album is a classic almost all of them are in rotation on classic rock station even so the song do n't seem worn out or dated ric ocasek had a genuine ear for pop which he melded with the band new wave sensibility in order to create a classic album 

when this album wa released i wa the perfect age to receive it i wa a hard core music fan yet bored with hard rock and prog embarrassed at the disco movement too naive to appreciate soul and funk too cool to listen to top 40 bubblegum and too suburban to accept brittish punk rock i wa hungry for new cutting edge tune since led zep stone tull kiss and others became soooooooooo stale along come the car today the car sound so tame and nostalgic but in 1978 this stuff could n't be any more hip with the reverb soaked detached vocal synthasized sounding drum compressed guitar and adventerous keyboard i know it must sound hard to believe but just what i needed wa a complete breath of fresh air everybody and i mean everybody even my guitar teacher famous shred master michael angelo batio wa intrigued by this fresh sound and they were sorry for the pun thought of a truly a new wave of musical talent in my high school the cool kid abandoned everything and embraced hippness of the car now in hindsight it is easy to see why the car made such a quick impact these were hardly young kid but rather they were seasoned veteran honing their craft writing finely composed song and applying high quality musicianship guitarist elliot easton wa a good of a chicken picker on a telecaster a anybody ric ocasek wa a seasoned songwriter keyboard player greg hawkes wa a session player and drummer dave robinson came out of the modern lover these guy must have studied velvet underground lou reed iggy pop and roxy music since you can hear the influence everywhere their debut ha many of their best song the good time roll ha all of the above quality ingredient the aforementioned cool detached singing motorizing guitar and in your face keyboard theme my best friend 's girl change the pace beautifully mixing new wave with twanging rockabilly moving in stereo is a hypnotic groove oriented song you 're all i got tonight test your speaker by utilizing all the right stereophonic squib and squall because these guy were so experienced musically their sound seems to have quickly moved on and matured which may have been ironically to their disadvantage since in the end they sounded like everybody else each album lost more of the edge that attracted me i think their debut and candy o are their best album since they were the most adventerous 

the car were a breath of fresh air in 1978 disco and sappy pop wa the rule in '78 but with this release by these boston modern rocker it would lead to a 9 year relationship with this band led by guitarist vocalist ric ocasek bassist vocalist ben orr guitarist elliot easton drummer from the modern lover david robinson and keyboardist greg hawkes produced by englishman roy thomas baker the car 18 is just a tremendous release with such classic a just what i needed 27 good time roll 41 my best friend girl 35 i'm in touch with your world do n't cha stop your all i 've got tonight bye bye love the moody moving in stereo and one of the best song ever in rock history that radio never play all mixed up in le than a year they would come out with another great album candy o 

34 we used to joke that the first album should be called the cars' greatest hit 34 said guitariest elliot easton their debut wa arty and punchy enough to be part of boston' new wave scene yet so catchy that nearly every track 34 good time roll 34 34 my best friend girl 34 landed on the radio 

there are precious few flawless album in rock and roll history this is one of them just a nirvana 's nevermind singlehandedly turned grunge into a mainstream phenomenon so it wa for new wave with the cars' debut album and just like nirvana fostered countless unlistenable imitator so did the car but i have a choice not to listen to all of the bad new wave that followed this and i also have a choice to listen to this impossibly catchy album a long a i have functioning ear drum for those who are only familiar with the car through classic rock radio this is the car cd to get it 's a rare instance where one of the band 's original album is the first choice over a greatest hit package 

the car 's debut album in 1978 represents the good ol' day of american rock they are categorized a a new wave artist but to them they were struggling to create what american rock compared to uk rock should be evolved with the huge success of boston foreigner styx and kansa they were trying to do something different while retaining mainstream pop vibe the band challenge foreigner with hard edged and upbeat track just what i needed while creating radio friendly first three song they were experimenting what music fan at that time might never been experienced fourth track i'm in touch with your world invite listener to the uncharted territory then at fifth track they again put out upbeat track don't cha stop then they turn to progressive hard rock edged you are all i've got tonight listener might have enjoyed what they might call mystery drive tour the last two track often aired in pair are truly what make the band 's debut album a legend verdict impeccable and exciting debut album by another new giant rating 93 out of 100recommended for late 70 pop rock fan 

my native boston based rocker the car released their self titled debut in june of 1978 the car wa formed by rhythm guitarist singer songwriter ric ocasek and bass player singer the late benjamin orr prior to the formation of the car orr and ocasek were in a popular boston act called cap'n swing along with lead guitarist and berkeley school of music grad elliot easton they broke up in 1975 and the trio joined force with former modern lover drummer david robinson and keyboard player greg hawkes in 1976 for a year they did well gigging around new england and their demo of just what i needed became a hugely requested song on a local boston rock station wbcn for those who want to know a a result elektra record signed the band and the label decided to pull out the artillery for this new band and have legendary queen producer roy thomas baker produce this incredible debut which wa recorded in london england at george martin 's air studio with engineer geoff workman another queen and journey veteran when this album came out it wa a smash and 30 plus year later it is still a masterpiece the album 's first three track were all hit single good time roll is a great opening song on this album with a killer guitar riff and what not next is my best friend 's girl is another great song and i think of this song from the 1979 matt dillon film debut over the edge where he told a cop off a the policeman wa arresting one of his friend the song is great too with a guitar solo reminiscent to the beatles' i will in tone the song that follows wa just what i needed which wa america 's intro to the band and wa orr 's vocal debut on a car track ben and ric would split the vocal evenly the track is still a staple of rock radio this track too appeared in over the edge prior to the film 's party scene i'm in touch with your world and dont'cha stop are also great rocker which close the first half of the album with classic ric vocal ric sang most of the first half except a noted those track ended the first half wanting more the rock radio staple you 're all i 've got tonight kick the second half off in a grand way and is a killer rocker the only vocal from ric in the second half a ben did the rest bye bye love is next and another great rocker a well and a rock radio staple a is most of this album we segue into the classic moving in stereo which is one of the band 's best piece of music and the song is forever etched in our brain a that image of phoebe cates in the red swimsuit coming out of the pool in fast time at ridgemont high the closing all mixed up is a great song a well and a great way to close this album this album fittingly got the success it deserved and not only did new wave fan buy and embrace this album in drove but hard rock fan did a well and sold million and peaked in the u top 20 this version of the album wa remastered in 1998 by joe gastwirt and rhino then upped the anty by issuing a deluxe edition in 1999 highly recommended 

after year of listenting to metal rock pop rock i heard this album and the world turned on it 's head for a moment for me of course my first intro to something other than 'free burd' and although it took some getting used to this still remains on my list a one of the best new wave rock classic album of all time the 'best of' they did cover the hit but this cd from start to finish is a work of new wave art rarely matched by their contemporary except maybe the 1st pretender album they the car brought cynicism to a new level without being obsessed with anger etc this cd ha an underlying power to it that is unmatched by others one that will remain a a cd that listened today 20 year on for a reason beyond their sheer popularity 

the cars' self titled debut album which introduced the band 's unique blend of the velvet underground the steve miller band and roxy music is their most balanced album a far a vocal are concerned with lead vocal about equally split between ben orr r i p and ric ocasek orr 's vocal are more melodic than ocasek 's a the latter seems to have some vocal tic that can be annoying at time this wa n't a problem on the first two album or heartbeat city a these record have enough hook to compensate for any vocal shortcoming that the bandmembers might have had but it wa a severe issue on panorama if you 're hoping for a car reunion sadly it will never happen bassist vocalist ben orr died of pancreatic cancer in 2000 

if you love this album a much a i still do pony up the extra couple of buck and be prepared to be wowed loud go for the double disc deluxe set which sport a great remaster the car wa a classic debut and one of the first band with a new wave association to actually make it big their blend of irony laden roxy bowie pop and am radio hook made my best friend 's girl and just what i needed sound like top 40 classic from play one and the rest of the album skirted experimental stuff like moving in stereo with the classic nervy album rock ready sound of good time roll roy thomas baker 's spare production is gave the band a sharper focus and made the song leap from the speaker with a fresh sound the band 's arsenal wa well loaded greg hawkes brought keyboard to the front of the band a well a his sax work elliot easton made his choppy guitar work a fluid a it wa jittery and ben orr and ric ocasek switched vocal just enough that while there wa variety it wa seamless true original the car were often aped but never replicated a opposed to the dozen of joe jackson elvis costello copycat and it make this debut sound great almost 25 year after it wa released 

not sure why it is not listed a such but wanted to confirm that this 6 99 elektra release is hdcd remastered and sound fantastic panorama and candy o also received the same quality hdcd remaster and sound great a well unfortunately the elektra 6 99 shake it up and heartbeat city release did not receive this remastering and the difference show especially on siu 

i do n't know why so many people claim the car invented quot new wave quot they did have that sort of weird keyboard sound but their music wa straight popular hard rock they are more in the vein of group like loverboy then quot new wave quot they had the sound of the early 80 's mtv group but in a rock style quot just what i needed quot wa an instant classic with me and my hard rock fan friend in the summer of '78 good stuff 

i got into the car around the time i wa 14 due to smoking mad pot drinking beer and hearing the song just what i needed all the time on my local classic rock radio station i remember the exact moment that i actually heard this song i had a nice buzz going and i wa chasing this hot little ticket around this beach we used to hang out at i had a baby boom box in my hand and this song wa playing suddenly i stopped everything because it seemed that i had become surrounded by this incredibly transfixing electronic music this of course is the synth hook from the song oh yeah the next day i asked my mom if she had any car record and indeed she did this one i never gave new wave a chance before this record however there wa no doubt a lot of fun music on here with a solid rock edge to it very cool these guy innovated the new wave sound which of course would mutate substantially in the decade that followed leading to some good some bad and some downright irritating music the car for the most part remained pretty good although their music gradually lost the rock edge and just went into realm of stray pop up until they fell apart in the mid late eigthies but this is their best album for sure along with the second candy o the album is just partying it up until the end where you get an awesome tripped out bit of electronica moving in stereo you may remember this song from the movie fast time at ridgemont high when that extremely fresh young thing come walking out of the swimming pool uh huh let the good time roll for sure 

the car formed in boston circa 1976 and debuted in 1978 with this eponymously titled release straddling the line between rock and new wave the group managed to maintain rock credibility while also racking up some major pop hit just what i needed peaked at 27 and ha become a rock radio staple the single is my favorite song of all time it so perfectly encapsulates the late 70 new wave scene and it 's catchy a hell i have to turn up the radio whenever i hear it the second single my best friend 's girl went to 35 the song start with handclap before a major synth line kick into gear finally good time roll just missed the top 40 peaking at 41 however not a single track is filler any of them could have been a hit i wa a little too young in 1978 to become a car fan although i caught them in their pop heyday when drive wa a major hit i 've picked up the rest of their catalog in the last few year and i 've been blown away by the quality of their music especially the car propulsive synths combine seamlessly with the rock edged guitar to form one of the most distinctive sound ever this cd really demonstrates why the car became star it still sound completely amazing the car sold very well when first released and wa certified platinum in late 1978 since then the cd ha continued to win fan with certification for sale of 6 million by 1995 every time i hear the killer or other current retro new wave band i want to throw on this cd and hear how it wa done right the first time around most highly recommended 

ah the car the greatest band that nobody seems to give a about anymore and their debut album is one of the few album i know of that are comprised almost entirely of radio hit yet never ever becomes tiring to listen to it all start out with the boston band 's mission statement 'good time roll' followed by the charming 'my best friend 's girl' which contain some of ric ocasek 's best lyric ric 's always been terribly underrated a a songwriter few writer then or now could be a witty yet moving dark yet delicate and loving in his put down 'just what i needed' the album 's highest charting single is the debut of the much missed benjamin orr on vocal this track is truly classic car the next two song 'i'm in touch with your world' and 'do n't cha stop' i used to dislike but have grown to love them the former is so disjointed in structure it reminds me a little of the cars' third album panorama while the latter song is one in a long line of ultra fun fast car rocker 'you 're all i 've got tonight' can either be construed a insulting or pleading either way it 's perfect 'bye bye love' is my favorite from this album one of ben orr 's best lead vocal in my opinion the last two song 'moving in stereo' featured in a memorable scene in fast time at ridgemont high yeah that scene and 'all mixed up' show the deeper darker side of the car which i 've always loved the most the cars' debut album remains easily their best known and along with heartbeat city probaby their best 

brian wilson wa so blown away after hearing rubber soul by the beatles that he felt the need to compete with them so he immediately went to work on a new album in the first few month of 1966 what he came up with go even further than the amazing rubber soul in melody and harmony development brian had a genius ear when it came to crafting melody so he wa at the height of his power here he went to work at this while his fellow beach boy were on tour and developed a dozen sophisticated song that expressed how he wa feeling inside this wa totally new in rock music at the time so it is a landmark recording to open up the album we have quot would n't it be nice quot which is a sweet song with a phenomenal bridge quot you still believe in me quot is a minor melody ballad that is really beautiful the song is very emotional with moving progression and is most striking at the part where he sings quot i wanna cry quot over a feast of note quot that 's not me quot is sung by mike love and is another highlight with it key change then come quot do n't talk put your head on my shoulder quot another emotional ballad that come to a climax in the middle when brian tell u to quot listen quot with the sad violin coming directly afterwards quot i'm waiting for the day quot is faster and neat but then come quot let 's go away for awhile quot which is a very moving instrumental full of violin hawaiian styled guitar and string quot sloop john b quot is said to be the least striking on the album but it 's actually really good and it ha a beautiful a capella section in the middle quot god only know quot ha been called by paul mccartney the best song ever written so many excellent song have been written but it doe have excellent harmony vocal and it 's another highlight then come the wonderful quot i know there 's an answer quot and after that is quot here today quot which is the most ambitious of all the song although it appears quaint with it production it ha some neat key and tempo change within it fairly sparse minor key melody next is quot i just wa n't made for these time quot which is sung from the heart and is another minor ballad like the rest near the end we get the title track the second instrumental of the album which us two coke bottle for percussion and more hawaiian guitar finally quot caroline no quot end the album on a graceful and sad note and show that this is a truly genius piece of work it 's hard to express the utter perfection and beauty on this record even though the bonus track quot hang on to your ego quot is nothing special you 'd really just have to hear it buy it you fool 

i never understood what 's the big deal behind this album yes the production is wonderfull but the songwriting is childish and rubbish brial wilson definitly can not write great lyric like bob dylan sometimes do god only know and wouldnt be nice are indeed masterpiece but the rest of the album is background music 

for those that say they quot do n't get it quot you have to understand at that point in time when this album wa released no one had ever tried any of the thing that the beach boy ie brian wilson tried that wa is quot pet sound quot i hear a lot of babble from those that quot do n't it get quot that it sound like bland harmonizing vocal etc etc the album is a masterpiece simply because of the daring arrangement the use of sound that no one at that time had thought of using in the way that they were used the drum work you can hear how ringo starr wa influenced on sgt pepper you can hear how the use of quot sample quot ie the sound of the train at the end of quot caroline no quot wa used on sgt pepper or the beginning of quot god only know quot go listen to quot being for the benefit of mr kite quot off sgt pepper and you will hear where the influence for the beginning of that song started these are thing that make this album special they were the 1st band to try thing like this using those sound the arrangement themselves of the song are just simply brilliant they can actually be compared to classical the brilliance of quot sloop john b quot go listen to the ballad of quot john amp yoko quot or quot ob li di ob li da quot and you can hear an influence of this song in those song the beach boy created brilliance those who do not get it are not listening or do not understand the history of music for those who have not heard this album and are wondering if you will enjoy it all i can tell you is to ask yourself first how much are you into musicology and if you have an open mind 

brian wilson once said of this album he wanted to write song on more than one level and since the term classic album is often overdone and often used without care brian 's own term seem to define this album very much and there are very few full lengh album over the year that i can say exist on more than one level the work of marvin gaye stevie wonder and the beatles come to mind this is one of those record i can put on with absolutely no urge to skip over any song the key to the entire success of this album wa arrangement inspired by the vocal harmony of pop and doo wop group along with the wall of sound production of phil spector wilson created this which basically amount to his debut solo album co staring the beach boy on vocal and harmonizes aside from that carl dennis mike and al had precious little to do with the music on this album that 's where the name come from these were in fact brian 's pet sound based on musical influence that impacted on him personally this album is home to some truly wonderful song much heard and well known hit such a would'nt it be nice and god only know being among them and interestingly enough if those song excite and amaze you than the rest of this album will be right up your alley much a the beatlessgt pepper 's lonely heart club bandwas supposed to be but which even john lennon admitted it actually wa n't this album is completely musically and thematically unified this is not the work of an adolescent celebrating california surf culture this is the work of a reflective and yearning 20 something who 'd by this point already experienced physical abuse mental illness and wa now married with a baby on the way speaking for a generation obsessed with the eternal youth this set the record straight on that on i know there 's an answer caroline no here today and beautifully chorded piece such a i just wa n't made for these time do n't talk and that 's not me there 's this prevailing sense that the singer songwriter who once mused about the delight of being in my room now saw the music world a forcing him to pay a big price for non conformity musically well on this you here an album that go for redefining what rock and roll wa rather than having a lot of distorted guitar in the mix playing three noisy chord you have elaborate organ piano horn rhythm based song that are more about melody harmonic and chordal invention that making noise and rocking out on the instrumental title track for example you realize this album ha a lot more in common with type of northern soul recording from dusty springfield or georgie fame for example it 's not by any mean a guitar rock album band such a the high llama 's would later make music very much based on this sound but it definitely extends off the beach boy surf sound into something that come very directly from brian wilson 's soul he would in fact suffer something of an emotional breakdown whilst attempting to outdo himself with the follow up album to this that also mixed with the fact the blood and sweat perfectionism brian put into this product wa n't fully appreciated by every member of the beach boy but that 's another story 

you know even with classic radio hit like quot would n't it be nice quot quot god only know quot and quot sloop john b quot i just ca n't putthe beach boy quot pet sound quot into my cd player and not listen tothe entire album in one sitting i 'd be missing out on my favoritesongs like quot do n't talk quot quot let 's go away for awile quot quot caroline no quot quot i just wa n't made for these time quot i can go on and on really this ha le weak cut then the beatles quot sgt pepper quot and thatonly had one mildly weak song if that tell you anything okay order this now it will brighten your day 

this album wa originally released on and is still distributed by capitol record capitol 's original catalog number is dt 2458 for the stereo lp and t 2458 for the mono lp the stereo copy were duophonic meaning they could only be played on stereo phonograph for maximum sound quality but then again you 'd get good quality sound if you played a duophonic copy on a monaural phonograph stereo lp copy of the best of the beach boy were duophonic also hit from this album include sloop john b god only know and wouldn't it be nice this album wa a best seller when it wa released in 1966 the beach boy were still in their teen idol phase then a wa their capitol labelmates the beatles and peter gordon also then brian wilson began to have problem with drug he 'd remain with the band in the studio but turned his duty on the stage to bruce johnston all the other song are good 

is there anything about quot pet sound quot that ha n't been said already it is already well established that to many rock historian that this the greatest album ever made i am one of the many fan who agree that opinion this is truly the beach boy in their prime here 's where you 'll find two of the greatest single of all time quot would n't it be nice quot and quot god only know quot here 's where you 'll find it somewhat lesser but still masterful uber twin quot sloop john b quot here 's the album that feature such great track a quot here today quot quot you still believe in me quot quot i know there 's an answer quot and the aching quot i just wa n't made for these time quot not to mention the sad charm of brian 's yearning quot caroline no quot for an album of 100 percent pure rock with absolutely no filler this is the album you want and there 's a few new bonus added to this disc first there 's an incredibly thick booklet with rare photo and insightful liner note by the great david leaf and there 's a bonus track quot hang on to your ego quot is the original version of quot i know there 's an answer quot then finally after that there 's the entire album repeated again in stereo form bring it total track number to 27 not bad for an album that wa originally le than an hour long the bottom line is that this is great album that should be cherished by young and old alike and to get a more complete feel of brian wilson 's genius after you listen to the entire album purchase quot the pet sound boxed set quot featuring over 100 track from the quot pet sound quot session the point is just buy it 

after reaping huge success both commercial and critical with quot the beach boy today quot leader and producer brian wilson set out to make an album even better than that what he came up with ha been called the greatest album of all time 1966 's quot pet sound quot wa the least successful beach boy album up to that time barely hitting the top 10 it peaked at 10 and not going gold so it 's no small irony that it remains their best and popular album of all time under wilson 's guidance the group became more experimental moving out of their signature quot surf rock quot realm and writing song that dealed with real life issue such a maturity quot would n't it be nice quot love quot do n't talk put your head on my shoulder quot quot you still believe in me quot rejection quot here today quot quot i just wa n't made for these time quot quot caroline no quot even death the ethereal quot god only know quot with carl wilson 's angel like vocal and brian 's stunning production the only song that seems even remotely like their earlier work is quot sloop john b quot but while this one ha to do with the ocean they loved so much it is more of a distress call than an ode to summer fun the two instrumentals quot let 's go away for awhile quot and the title track are great the former is carried on by the gentle slightly mysterious vibraphone and great string while the latter is a sidewinding instrumental workout quot i know there 's an answer quot is a crackerjack keyboard workout with a fierce chorus and scorching lyric the bonus track another version of the song entitled quot hang on to your ego quot is just the same song with just the title line changed quot pet sound quot now come with a beautiful booklet filled with picture and track information brian wilson provides a wonderful inroduction and the essay is beautifully written verall this is what i conisder the greatest album of all time for me to be a great album the album ha to really speak to you and quot pet sound quot speaks to me because a i mentioned earlier it talk about the issue in our life if you want an album look no further than quot pet sound quot 

you do n't need a rocket scientist to inform you that the beach boys' 1966 album pet sound is one of the top 10 greatest album ever made not much is left to say that ha n't already been said about the album song for song the record is pure perfection from the youthful abandonment of would n't it be nice to the dramatism present on sloop john b to the heartugging god only know voted the greatest love song of all time to the poignancy of i just wa n't made for these time to the chilling caroline no there is not one clunker on the whole cd this newly remastered edition feature the entire album in both stereo and mono in both form the album sound absolutely fantastic there y also an excellent booklet filled with some great essay and rare pcitures definitey a must have album 

it 's now very well known that the labelling on this disc is deceptive it wa not taken from the original analog master tape but from a second generation copy and dat sonically it is not bad but not anywhere close to the earlier gold cd from the now defunct dcc not enough of an upgrade over the last capitol remaster to be worthwhile 

i am very disapointed after looking for this album for 10 year at least i bought it and masterpiece c'mon people i have around 2000 rock album in my collection and i would never placed this not even between the top 100 how could anyone say that rubber soul or revolver are under pet sound any 60 's rolling stone album is one hundred time better and something else if this is the sound that shape the american pop music i might be wrong but where is jimi hendrix muddy water mile davis etc those are really master of american music not the beach boy i ca n't give to this album more than half star 

pet sound seems to be compared a lot on this website to sgt pepper 's lonely heart club band which might be okay since the beatles were so impressed with the beach boy new at that time album but at the same time the comparasion is ridiculous both are legendary album in different way and pet sound for a moment in time made the beach boy the greatest rock and roll band in the whole world even bigger than there friendly competitor the beatles who came right back and took the title away from them with revolver first off pet sound is a far far departure from the beach boy that most people know and love these song are n't about fun in the sun girl and surfing instead it is a deep examination of the thought and dream of a young boy and how they change a he grows older and his problem and worry become bigger issue for him to deal with many people know that brian wilson the leader of the band and the creator of this album had many mental problem and also had various drug addiction at this time a well so he had a thousand idea that he wa thinking about also brian wa an obsessed perfectionist he wanted to create an album that wa greater than anything that had come out before he spent hour upon hour in the studio creating layer upon layer of sound and vocal using any instrument available even soda can he created a sound that wa more lush and beautiful than anything ever before creating almost a dream sound of reflection of a boy becoming a man who for his whole life wa yearning for the love and affection that he felt wa missing pet sound is brian wilson 's baby and many even argue that this wa his solo debut a a back up band wa used on many of the song instead of his fellow band mate however the harmony and vocal are what make this so pleasing and only his band mate could help in that the song themself are pretty excellent would n't it be nice sloop john b and god only know are the well known song and the only one that you are able to listen to a single the other song you have to listen to along with the album a they paint the whole picture that way the album is about one man 's search for love from boyhood to manhood and the pain and hurt he go through in his search for it if wilson 's lyric do n't make you reflect yourself or even make you feel the pain then listen again and again and see how the album will move you in way your never felt possible such a complex and challenging album to listen to that is essential to every rock and roll fan collection while this album might have started the break down of brian wilson and while the rest of the band mate did n't necessarily agree with the direction the music wa heading in more song influenced by drug and mental illness which the band wa n't dead set on singing the lyric to for one moment this album made them king brian wa working on his next project smile when the beatles released sgt pepper after listening to it wilson put up his white flag of surrender the others went back to the simple day of surf rock and the beach boy never reached the level of creativeness and uniqueness a they did with pet sound 

please see producer mark linett 's review under the deluxe fuzzy version of this new cd dvd the mono version of the album ha been remastered from a superior source to that used in 2000 and a more complete version of hang on to your ego ha been used 

released in may 1966 pet sound wa the album that saw the beach boy graduate from purveyor of perfectly crafted lightweight pop like sufin usa fun fun fun et al into a vehicle for the mature compositional genius of brian wilson though it wa not an huge hit it became hugely influential on pop and rock musician most notably the beatles whose sgt pepper drew inspiration from this album a paul mccartney would gladly tell you and many others old and new too numerous to mention for me it wa the first time i truly enjoyed the beach boy because it wa a work that expressed emotion that i could relate to like finding true love being insecure not fitting in and loss of innocence it also had the most gorgeous and most haunting melody harmony sound and song ever commited to tape like god only know caroline no i'm waiting for the day would n't it be nice and others a well it made me look past the corny striped shirt fun in the sun image and made me realize that this band had a much deeper more substatial body of work than i thought and it ha given me great comfort to my heart soul and ear since then that 's probably the reason why this album 's rep a the greatest album of the 20th century still continues to grow and deepen with each passing year 

pet sound being the beach boy 11th studio album and their 1966 release and single released on the album were caroline no would n't it be nice sloop john b and god only know yes it is a good album however to compare it with sgt pepper 's lonely heart club band doe not work for me a i consider beatles to be far superior even rolling stone ha made better album then this however do not get me wrong this is a good album but not a good a many would have you believe the booklet is very nice with many photograph liner note written by brian wilson and david leaf no lyric are included but we get a list of whom play what on each track 4 5 

i often write about heart and soul when reviewing cd describing the enormous effort musician put into their work certainly there are many band and singer who have devoted their life to music but never ever have i heard an album that is remotely close to the breathtaking pet sound a far a work ethic creativity perseverence and in the end pure perfection many people liken pet sound to the beatles sgt pepper album people often criticize sgt pepper for taking it influence from the primordial pet sound but the fact that brian wilson wa first inspired to make pet sound after he heard rubber soul is often overlooked here 's what he said in the liner note quot in december of 1965 i heard the album rubber soul by the beatles it wa definitely a challenge for me i saw that every cut wa very artistically interesting and stimulating i immediately went to work on the song for pet sound quot a a huge fan of both the beatles and the beach boy i find it absolutely wonderful and riveting that the two biggest band from across the sea were involved in somewhat of an artistic spar one which ended up helping both band produce some of their greatest music a far a the individual song of this album there are no high and low pet sound stay at a steady constant of brilliance sounding at an uncalibrated musical high from the swirling harmony of the opening would n't it be nice to the wonderful coda of hang on to your ego this recording is thoroughly enjoyable my personal favorite are would n't it be nice god only know and i just wa n't made for these time to wrap thing up with a hackneyed yet appropiate cliche your music collection is incomplete without pet sound 

1966 wa an annus mirabilis for rock music the greatest band of the british invasion the beatles the stone the kink began to reliably deliver set of all original material instead of dividing their lp between cover and original the who 's first great album wa released in 1967 moreover the lp became more important a a complete artistic statement resulting in great record revolver aftermath face to face rather than simply great single while great but fairly simple pop music had been produced prior to this year 1966 wa the year in which rock band began to challenge themselves and their audience with more sophisticated songcraft the beach boys' 1966 release pet sound wa the best example of an american band making this leap inspired by the previous year 's rubber soul beach boy mastermind brian wilson along with lyricist tony asher wa determined to make a record that would keep them on par with the fab four commercially and artistically many including paul mccartney himself maybe would argue that pet sound surpassed rubber soul 's achievement only to be outdone itself a few month later by revolver i flatter myself to think that people have read my other review but i make it clear time and again that sgt pepper wa just another beatles album so i am going to disregard it here whatever the case my be pet sound turned out to be a huge critical smash on both side of the atlantic strangely it wa le of a commercial hit in america not only than it wa in britain but than it predecessor in the u had been i will try even if i have already partially failed to avoid rehashing everything that ha already been said about pet sound and attempt to review it strictly on it musical merit and how well it ha endured over the past 40 year by these standard it is factually a great and truly unique record one would search in vain for chuck berry style riff and solo that were a trademark of their previous record in fact the closest thing one find to guitar riff at all are the plethora of plump high pitched bass line but not to worry about the trademark vocal harmony they are a plentiful and a gorgeous a ever the single are clearly the pillar of the album and are enough by themselves to make this a worthy record but while would n't it be nice sloop john b god only know and caroline no are all great do n't talk put your head on my shoulder that 's not me here today and i know there 's an answer are also exceptionally vital number the remaining song are not quite a great but they are good enough to help earn pet sound the reputation that it ha even the two instrumentals are quite strong and serve a highlight for the unprecedented variety of instrumentation throughout the disc including tympani horn tuba christmas y bell and of course the theremin the overall sound of the record is wholesome and magical and find kindred spirit in late sixty lp such a love 's forever change and odessey and oracle by the zombie and in more recent release like the flaming lips' the soft bulletin hence pet sound wa not a traditional rock record at all when released in may 1966 rather it wa the origin of what would come to be called baroque or chamber pop influence and endurance are essential to an album 's greatness however it seems to me that sometimes influence and endurance are overemphasized and used to hide the fact that a given record 's song are not really all that good ultimately what good is a great record if it doe n't have great song on it pet sound need n't worry about lacking any of the necessary element but most importantly it is the song themselves that would earn this record the high rating that i have awarded it even if it were not so influential and enduring in term of it standing in the beach boy catalog it is obviously their best record but it is also something equally important the point at which the sun began to set on these california boys' endless summer gone are the surfboard fast car and hamburger stand that is n't to say that they would n't return but at this time brian wilson wa dealing more with the fleeting nature of the pleasure of youth embodied by caroline who said she 'd never change but did in doing so he created a record that is artistically influential historically enduring and with nary a weak track truly great 

this one is a strong contender for best rock album of all time and should be in everyone 's collection period now it ha been reissued countless time i think i have owned three different version at least unfortunately the best version ever released look like is no longer available a stunning one cd containing all track in both stereo and mono for the price of a regular cd now these version are sold separately which one to buy originally the album wa released and mixed in mono only recently wa the album remixed in stereo so if you are interested in the history behind this album and the whole `painting a moustache on the mona lisa' issue get the mono version with the stereo version although you get all the inherent improvement of stereo sound some sound from the original album are lost in the stereo mix nevertheless bottom line for my ear the stereo will always sound best and that is the version i listen to most the extra track is just `i know there is an answer' with different lyric nothing revealing 

what can you say that ha n't been already said or written about this splendid album when i first heard this album in 1966 i wondered quot what the heck is this quot this wa n't about girl surf and hot rod after a few listening i could n't get it out of my head the whole recording is like a dream brian wilson 's arrangement and use of unique instrument make for a lasting and memorable piece of work it is a surprisingly mature work for one of brian 's age at the time every song is a gem it 's the only popular album whose beauty ha brought me close to tear if you have n't got this cd in your collection your collection is not complete i can see where brian wilson 's sensativity could only lead to his world of isolation withdrawal and dissapointment with a world not a idealistic a he would wish after reaching such perfection anything else is anti climatic 

what is the big deal would n't it be nice and caroline no are great song there 's 3 more good song and a nice instrumental and the rest is filler sure it great for a beach boy album but in the great universe of music this is just a really good pop album i suppose if i 'd never heard jazz or classical music i too would think that brian 's use of vibraphone and glockenspiel wa some sign of genius and if i 'd never heard the platter the letterman or manhattan transfer i too would think that the beach boy were a great vocal band brian brought a good sense of vocal and instrumental arrangement together with some good material to create a pop record that had more depth than most at the time of it release just keeping it real 

quot pet sound quot ha become one of my all time favorite record i ca n't stop playing this newer version the first 14 song are recorded in mono then repeat in stereo when paul mccartney and george martin heard quot pet sound quot they were amazed this album wa the blueprint for the classic quot sgt pepper lonely heart club band quot and the beatles quot rubber soul quot wa the blueprint for this record brian wilson wa blown away after hearing the album he stopped touring with the beach boy and just wanted to work in the studio quot pet sound quot is more of a solo record by brian and his partner tony asher when the single quot caroline no quot came out the beach boy name wa n't even on the record the cut bearly made the top 40 no one knew who brian wilson wa this is my second favorite cut from the album quot god only know quot with carl wilson on lead is unreal the vocal arangments are perfection and it one of the first song to have god in it this ha got to be one of the greatest record ever made my other favorite cut are quot you still believe in me quot i'm waiting for the day quot and quot i know there 's an answer the cd come with a 31 page booklet that tell you all about the recording of the album i 've been playing this cd for two week and i ca n't get these song out of my head at night the harmony the weird sound this record is a classic 

pet sound hauntingly beautiful stunningly majestic fantastically oh look wait a minute let cut to the chase repeat after me i must own this album i must own this album or sadly yes youve guessed it it mean booking an appointment in the funny farm youve probably got sgt pepper right well this came before and it wa instrumental in the beatles recording said masterpiece brian wilson never really came near to this quantum leap project again bit of surf up are ok holland ha a few gem but this is the one so repeat after me i must own 

a worthy purchase value for money is what this dvd a is all about 3 version of this classic album video footage and a booklet with good info on the recording process and personel one thing that i wa surprised wa the fact hardly any beach boy play a note on these track nevertheless it 's a masterpiece worth getting 

there 's a reason this is often called one of the best album ever it really is one of the best album ever it 's virtually flawless the music lyric and fantastic harmonious vocal make this an incredible listening experience mostly everyone know the big hit on here like would n't it be nice and god only know i held off on getting pet sound for year because i already had those and a few of the other song on other beach boys' compilation big mistake on my part one of the great thing about pet sound is hearing it in it 's entirety the song flow together perfectly also there are some great song on here like that 's not me and i just wa n't made for these time that were n't popular radio tune and do n't turn up on the countless beach boy best of compilation that are out there the song are totally worth hearing and there 's no better place to get them than right here believe all the hype you 've heard pet sound is a fantastic album if you love great music and who doe n't then you 'll love this album 

the beach boys' pet sound is the best sunshine pop let alone 60 's pop album ever recorded this album is so original and so cheerful that you ca n't help but love it the most well known song on here are the hit would n't it be nice sloop john b god only know and caroline no but the other track are just a good and interesting the beach boy are famous for their harmony and vocal and this album doe not disappoint the musicianship is definitely 60 's but the audio quality and the instrumentation is perfect another great thing about this album is how quotable and interesting the lyric are they 're some of the best ever written you 'll absolutely love singing along to song like would n't it be nice fan of every genre will love this album you 'd be hardpressed not to a this is an instant classic buy it now highlight include the entire album 

you simply ca n't not have this album it 's ridiculous to imagine a collection without it this album suit any mood you could be in not just quot hey let 's go to the beach quot it could also help you shift your mood especially up just get it for pity 's sake 

y'all lost me when you declared pet sound a the best album of all time that 's simply a ridiculous claim hell i 'll take black sabbath 's paranoid or sticky finger by the stone or dark side of the moon by the floyd or kid a by radiohead or xtc 's nonesuch or king crimson 's discipline or the sex pistol or revolver by the beatles or axis bold a love by hendrix and many others and we 're just talking about rock here before pet sound any day now if you 'd said that pet sound wa the most influential album of all time i 'd have given a longer pause to reflect after all xtc would probably never have done nonesuch which owes a huge debt to the vocal harmony of the beach boy and the beatles would n't have done sgt pepper in order to compete with brian wilson 's masterpiece pet sound became for a brief time in the mid sixty a kind of pop music benchmark and wa the most complex and ambitious pop music album of it day and that ambition that desire to make rock 'n roll or pop music grander more musically serious is pet sound most profound and lasting legacy a legacy that influenced the beatles moody blue king crimson on up to pink floyd and beyond one could make a case that pet sound wa the first progressive rock album but it doe n't really matter if pet sound is the best or most influential album ever made what doe matter is that pet sound is sublime pop music the lyric may be slight so what the sound of this album is a gorgeous island of melodic and harmonic bliss it 's just damn beautiful at time very touching and should n't be missed do yourself a favor and check it out 

this is a exciting beach boy album and this is hailed a rock masterpiece by all the rock critic but they suck but i will recommend it this album came out in 1966 and even the beatles said quot how are ye gonna top this mate quot i give prop to mr cranky for his review one man with the ball to say what he think and everyone is going nut about it that would be good 1 would'nt be nice this one is a classic 10 102 you still believe in me this one wa pretty good 10 103 thats not me this one wa entertaining 9 104 thats talk put your head on my shoulder great 10 105 im wrating for the day this one is pretty good 10 106 go away for a while beautiful instrumental 10 107 sloop john b this one is another classic 10 108 god only know this one wa called the best song written 10 109 i know there answer this is short but sweet 10 1010 here today this one wa good 9 1011 i just wa n't made for these time good 8 1012 pet sound another instrumental that is great 10 1013 carolina no this is the last official song 10 10 ha dogs14 hold on to your ego this is a good song 10 1015 27 crappy remastered song my dad like i do n't this album wa produced by brian wilson but this should have included good vibration but still it is very good album lyric 10 production 10 music 10 style 10 voice 10overall 50 50 almost a perfect album still sound fresh in 04 

no one is educated musically until they 've heard pet sound it is a total classic record that is unbeatable in many way sir paul mccartneyand here 's another quote without pet sound sgt pepper would n't have happenned pepper wa an attempt to equal pet sound sir george martin producer the beatlesthere you have it folk given these reference there is no reason people should doubt the importance and greatness of this work of art i know what you 're thinking you hear the name 'beach boys' and you think of song like 'little deuce coup ' 'surfin' usa ' and 'kokomo ' right well those song are corny and they represent the nostalgia act that the beach boy have turned into over the last 30 year or so 'pet sounds' is brian wilson 's labor of love it represented the direction he wanted to take the band in which eventually caused confusion and dissagreement within the group no matter what kind of music you listen to whether it be rock rap metal country or classical it is vital that you own pet sound brian wilson 's writing skill a well a the vocal harmony throughout cannot be matched the two most popular song are probably 'would n't it be nice' and 'god only know ' both of these song have been used in countless movie including 'roger and me' and 'boogie night ' these song represent all that is right with the world and no matter what kind of mood you are in no matter what is going on in your life i promise you this album will cheer you up i am forever in debt to my good friend michael stack who once told me this record would change my life it did on a side note make sure you pick up the version of this record with 27 track which ha the entire album in mono and in stereo included in this is the bonus track 'hang on to your ego' which is just the track 'i know there 's an answer' with some lyrical change apparently people say that when you eat lsd you lose your ego pay attention to the word they trip through the day and waste all their thought at night this probably gave migraine to record executive at the time and the band wa forced to re write the track for radio play the beach boy were supposed to be a wholesome group not a bunch of guy doing drug and hanging out with the like of charles manson 

i understand why some people do n't like pet sound it 's kind of the citizen kane of album people hear the rep that this is one of the greatest record ever and they put it on expecting the direct propulsive creativity of say something like sgt pepper or good vibration and what they get is something milder something innocent something strangely muted then when it 's over they think that's one of the greatest album ever to an extent i wa one of those people i got pet sound when it first hit cd when i wa just about 20 and i 'd heard all the hype and i definitely liked it but at the time i also felt i wanted something more something that grabbed me by the collar and shook me but this is not an album that will shake you at least not violently an old girlfriend of mine once came into my house while i wa listening to this and actually got angry at it this is lullaby music this is like sesame street why are you listening to this i could n't explain it to her anymore than i could explain it to myself but this is an album that almost ha to grow on you the more you listen the more you learn the more you live the better it get there is a clutch of album that i have a tendency to drag out on dark night of the soul nick drake 's five leaf left beatles for sale john coltrane 's soultrane thelonious monk play duke ellington astral week dark side of the moon imperial bedroom the band and a few others but this is the one i put on when i just want to sit alone and stare out the window or drive around dark snowy neighborhood at night anyway i would never tell anyone like this album or you are wrong but for people who think it 's a sham i 'd recommend they listen to some key moment and reflect on what they 're hearing the bell and harmony of you still believe in me and particularly the line i wanna cry in which the word cry is given something like 15 lilting syllable the cello of do n't talk and i'm waiting for the day particularly the string that kick in at the 2 21 mark followed by rumbling kettle drum that would make phil spector tremble all of god only know the flickering texture of the bass guitar in here today the closing refrain of i just wa n't made for these time the weird kitschy sound of the title track brian 's truly beautiful lead vocal on caroline no followed by train sound and vocal by his dog banana and louie maybe the greatest saddest most wistful ending of any album ever made 

what do you know the album officially considered the greatest of all time might just be that i am innately hostile to canon their system of value and generally crippling influence they close down thought rather than encourage it but i think it 's fair to say that the influence of the beach boy and 'pet sounds' in particular ha inspired most of the great imaginative pop of the last three decade considering it reputation for sonic adventurousness i wa expecting something more lush more sound heavy but 'pet sounds' is actually quite austere effect never promoted at the expense of the beautiful song the most dominant feature is that thrilling soul shuddering thump drum echoing in vast spector al space making intense and urgent great catchy song like 'i'm waiting for the day' 'i know there 's an answer' and 'here today' there 's a mirroring of type on the album where similar song reflect and transform each other the serene sleepiness of 'do n't talk' refracting the shocked tragedy of 'caroline no' the frustrated dream of 'would n't it be nice' and the frustrating intention of 'here today' 's narrator 'pet sounds' is one of the great expose of the male psyche with it le endearing more devious and self serving impulse 'i'm waiting for the day' and 'here today' especially best of all is the tragus bathos of 'sloop john b' a male appropriation of the shangri la 's' traumatic pop made un tragic by youthful male ridiculousness yet still moving with it and the album 's refrain 'i want to go home' 

i am not a beach boy fan i consider this one of the 4 or 5 greatest album of all time the trouble with this album is that it constantly point out the musical genius and i do mean genius brian wilson wa and leaf you wondering how he could have plummeted to the depth that would hit him within just a few month of pet sound a much a i love quot would n't it be nice quot and quot sloop john b quot they seem second tier when heard in the context of this album quot i'm waiting for the day quot quot here today quot quot god only know quot and quot i just wa n't made for these time quot are all first rate pop pet sound also ha what i consider to be the greatest beach boy track quot caroline no quot it is a perfect recording of a heartbreaking lyric 

i collect beach boy this is just another example of the best album the beach boy ever put to wax after they released the cd the first time it contained the mono stereo version which i prefer the mono with a bonus track then a box set devoted to the album now they release it like the single cd but with a dvd to further cement this album a one of the best ever released i highly recommend this one if your looking to check out what the fuss is all about search judemac forever on msn 

i kind of have to laugh at the best album of all time discussion i have my own album that i consider the best of all time and they were all made within the last 15 year but that 's not the point the point is is the music great or not and i think it is granted this album doe have some song that you could reasonably call some of the greatest ever would n't it be nice god only know i just wa n't made for these time the other song are n't a strong but they 're good i do n't listen to pet sound much because i'm just not really into the high vocal pop sound going on here regardless i find the psychology of the album fascinating it 's commonly referred to a a coming of age album and in every song you can hear brian wilson 's fragile sensitive personality trying to come to term with the grown up world he 's just now experiencing the very fact that he wa able to get something like this across in pop music is pretty amazing he longs for a perfect romantic world on would n't it be nice simulatenously explores the joy of love and the terror of it absence on god only know and mourns the passing of his love and a more innocent worldview on caroline no one song in particular that i love but get overlooked is that 's not me while the vocal sound upbeat the lyric portray an absolutely heartbreaking scenario brian 's out in the big wild lonely world completely removed from the comfort and love of his home and know that 's not him the lyric are understated but so sad the other song might not be a intense but they 're fun to sing and well made they cover problem brian ha with other people like uptight people with big ego a girl he waited around for but doe n't love him now and a great warning to the new guy about his former lover in here today the other beach boy did a great job singing on the album even though they were despicable hack who treated brian like and butchered these song in the 80 's while brian 's new smile album is good i do n't think it really measure up to the innocence and charm of pet sound 

most young today people associate the beach boy music with surfing car chick and fun fun fun thus when the song would n't it be nice sloop john b and god only know are recycled for the umpteenth time on a compilation album it 's easy to overlook the wonderful production a well a the depth of it parent album pet sound since it set the standard for album for the last 34 year most seemed lost on it impact but when you truly listen and get inside these song that you really experience the beauty of this album the aforementioned theme are replaced with song of introspection and more adult theme brian wilson 's need to compete with the beatles turned into burning creativity a he recorded pet sound with meticulous attention to detail using some of phil spector 's wrecking crew a well a the famed wall of sound technique the album complexity wa nothing short of amazing song like that 's not me here today and caroline no display both beauty and sadness in their own unique way would n't it be nice god only know and waiting for the day are ray of light that seems on the brink of turning into dashed dream the beach boy harmony are flawless though since brian sings most of the lead you 'd almost think they 're guest star on their own album even for all it accolade pet sound wa deemed a failure back in '66 due to the general public a well a capitol record inability to understand and embrace the record but over the year it ha left the other beach boy album in the dust a well a accorded it own boxed set in '66 it seemed way ahead of it time nowadays it just exist outside of time 

most young today people associate the beach boy music with surfing car chick and fun fun fun thus when the song would n't it be nice sloop john b and god only know are recycled for the umpteenth time on a compilation album it 's easy to overlook the wonderful production a well a the depth of it parent album pet sound since it set the standard for album for over forty year most seemed lost on it impact but when you truly listen and get inside these song that you really experience the beauty of this album the aforementioned theme are replaced with song of introspection and more adult theme brian wilson 's need to compete with the beatles turned into burning creativity a he recorded pet sound with meticulous attention to detail using some of phil spector 's wrecking crew a well a the famed wall of sound technique the album complexity wa nothing short of amazing song like that 's not me here today and caroline no display both beauty and sadness in their own unique way would n't it be nice god only know and waiting for the day are ray of light that seems on the brink of turning into dashed dream the beach boy harmony are flawless though since brian sings most of the lead you 'd almost think they 're guest star on their own album even for all it accolade pet sound wa deemed a failure back in '66 due to the general public a well a capitol record inability to understand and embrace the record but over the year it ha left the other beach boy album in the dust a well a accorded it own boxed set in '66 no one seemed to think how way ahead of it time it wa nowadays it exist outside of it 

pet sound is way over hyped 1 album of all time i do n't think so yes brian wilson is a genius but this album only ha three really high quality song on it would n't it be nice sloop john b and god only know the rest of the song besides the two instrumentals are rather bland and un melodic it part are greater than the sum i came to this conclusion after listening to the pet sound box set where each song is broken down to acappella vocal track and instrumental track this is where brian wilson 's genius can be really appreciated this would have been an excellent instrumental album with the exquisite musicianship and execution of each song it also allows the listener to spot glaringly to the repetitiousness of many of the song melody and lyrical phrasing the vocal harmony a always are outstanding put it all together however and the song are just somewhat average and bland with the exception of the three listed above greatest album of all time i do n't think so same can be said for the beatles sgt pepper 's lonely heart club band with the exception of a few song they are both rather bland album in the case of pet sound you can get the best song on a greatest hit album 

bought this album on reputation many critic would have it a the greatest album of all time the track listing had never grabbed me enough to want to get the album without the reputation given to it by the critic anyway i took a punt the cd i have is listed a released in 2001 and it ha the mono version of the album first then the stereo mix of the album there is a bonus track too which is a reworking of one of the song on the regular album on first listen i gave this album 77 5 100 on second listen and after listening to the mono mix a well it 's difficult to rate if it had 3 or 4 song i liked a much a sloop john b then it could be an easy 5 5 this album would score in the high 80 to 5 5 for me based on the fact that it is just so listenable no more killer track but no dud track either that 's been enough for me in the past to give an album 5 5 too with a band like the beach boy maybe there is just an expectation of lot of song up there with their poppy best on this album they move beyond their lyrically simple but highly infectious surf pop confection these song are n't memorable to me but i can imagine being pleasantly surprised at how pretty they are if i wa to dig this album out again of course sloop john b is a great cover by the band which they turned into a masterpiece perhaps it 's wrong to expect the other song to measure up to this in any case this album would be more uniform but still very strong without this classic on it and maybe easier to score overall the album ha many pleasant track with symphonic element to them at time lyric have depth which their early surf pop song do n't have not that this wa anything but a positive for those early song on second listen the album wa just an easy listening pleasure which i 've tended to reward here in the past with high score a difficult album to rate it 's listenability demand a high score though range 87 5 to 100 100 the all time classic sloop john b iconic intro glassy percussion a killer pop cover of the caribbean folk song ha a tuba i think and great harmony with good variety in the voice the best of the rest on second listen you still believe in me bumped this up from a nice lead vocal tone and melody cello harpsichord ha bicycle horn type sound a well caroline no same bump up a above but after my third listen on the mono mix ha chunky wooden percussion which is nice a pleasant track harpsichord big bass note and a pretty woodwind type of instrument the outro feature a train and barking dog then would n't it be nice album opener iconic lead guitar melody intro brass good stereo balance album of this era were experimenting with the new stereo capability and did n't often do stereo well by today 's standard i know there 's an answer catchy piano tambourine and a tuba type instrument double bass play in a jazzy kind of a way symphonic drum thoughtful lyric and a catchy chorus on second listen do n't talk put your head on my shoulder wa hoping that this wa a cover of the sugar 1950s pop ballad it 's not only ha one of the beach boy singing on this track feature organ bass piano violin and cymbal percussion let 's go away for a while a pleasant experimental instrumental drum and symphonic drum piano brass violin twangy string instrument and xylophone god only know horn bass sleigh bell interesting tone to the percussion some sort of keyboard effect violin and a lovely falsetto by one of the boy here today piano tuba tambourine symphonic element like brass double bass note picking catchy verse part i mean like the opening vocal melody on third listen i'm waiting for the day interesting symphonic drumming and other symphonic element feature a well quiet part alternate with with percussive passage which is a little bit catchy i just wa n't made for these time bass note harpsichord interesting percussion tone at time bongo symphonic drum at time woodwind i think that the mono version of this song may have that novelty instrument which wa often used in the 1950s the one where you waved your hand over an aerial type instrument which created sci fi type noise i forget what you call those the rest that 's not me organ dual lead guitar aboriginal percussion stick sound bass drum reflective lyric interesting pet sound instrumental with symphonic element maraca brass including a tuba twangy lead guitar bass interesting drum tone and a tambourine i think hang on to your ego a bonus track very similar to i know there 's an answer wikipedia 's entry for the album version state that this bonus track wa the original version but there were concern about supposed drug related theme a in the title personally i ca n't see it recommendation easy listening classic fleetwood mac fleetwood mac 2nd self titled album rumoursgenesis from genesis to revelationthe velvet underground the velvet underground nico the velvet underground 

once ranked the greatest album of all time i think it 's a solid 9 and love the beach boy sound but goat i would disagree 

the beach boy said it time and again that the beatles were their inspiration to keep writing good song and produce better music if only such competition existed in today 's sick joke of a music market and pet sound wa inspired by in my opinion the boys' best album rubber soul a record that wa n't heavy on the studio trick a it close second revolver wa america wa by 1966 still searching for a homegrown answer to top the boy from britain and pet sound wa supposed to be it a group that made it mark on the chart by singing about the beach and how superior one state 's woman probably again from the beach were to woman from the rest of the country were supposed to be the answer i do n't think so yeah yeah the beatles sung about teenybopper love in the beginning of their career but they progressed quite nicely i listened to pet sound quite a few time with an open mind and the only three song i wound up liking were the one i liked before would n't it be nice sloop john b and god only know which paul mccartney i believe called one of the prettiest song he ever heard it did n't grow on me and i wish i could have liked it more i do n't take away brian wilson 's producing capability but the beatles they were not nor could ever be 

this album is well known a brian wilson 's masterpiece but it 's also carl wilson 's masterpiece there are many collection of the beach boys' greatest hit out there and they 're worth having but pet sound is worth having no matter what else you may own it wa made a a single album during the age of hit single and it will blow your mind a a single album just listen to it straight thru without interruption 

unless you 're an avid reader of rolling stone 's retrospective issue you could easily forget that the beach boy were once a great band comparable to the beatles and that brian wilson wa considered a musical genius certainly the copious note included in the cd booklet here will vouch for that viewpoint with wilson finally completing his legendary smile recording after a 37 year break interest in the band 's recognizable music will likely cause an upswing in sale especially for this album long considered the masterpiece of their lengthy career inspired by the beatles' rubber soul wilson wanted to make an album that thematically integrated love and even inspirational song together he succeeded with their soaring yearning harmony and sunny california disposition intact pet sound is still great and made all the more resonant by it sophisticated instrumental arrangement and wilson 's creative musical invention song like would n't it be nice god only know i just wa n't made for these time and caroline no remain classic that go far beyond the aging gidget set and showcase their amazing ability a a vocal group the title track and the especially esoteric let go away for awhile unearth wilson 's talent for multi tracking and embracing different musical style without sacrificing the sound that wa essentially the band 's own this cd contains a bonus track hang on to your ego which is actually an alternate take of i know there 's an answer and for die hard fan the whole album is repeated in stereo i still prefer the original mono recording a they have the pop and crackle that capture a more innocent time in recording a nostalgic postcard for a band that once had the potential to supplant the fab four in creative output whereas the beatles retired amid inner turmoil at the height of their popularity thus assuring their legacy the beach boy languished into a parody of themselves a wilson wa facing demon of his own but at least there is this one album to treasure 

and not just for the more recognized song like would n't it be nice and god only know the majority of song are pretty mellow and understated but they sure leave an impact i 'll just say that no album collection is complete without this gem 

everyone else here seems to be doing it so here i go first i think the title of greatest album and greatest rock album are totally different pet sound doe not rock a much a the beatles album thrown into this discussion rubber soul revolver sgt pepper of those i 'd say revolver rock the most easily earning the title of greatest rock album then you 've got pet sound and sgt pepper bringing new sound and concept into popular music wonderfully orchestrated i consider both of these to be art more than rock though they do have their moment i 'd call it a toss up if it werent for the one track that stand outside of the performance of sgt pepper 's lhcb a day in the life that album closer is enough to push sgt pepper over the edge a the greatest general music album ever recorded a much of a genius a brian wilson wa he wa no substitute for the combined creative effort of john paul george and ringo 

i ca n't really say that i'm a huge beach boy fan i do n't particularly care for surf music or a lot of the beach boys' music for that matter lately i 've been on a music kick on checking out album that wa on vh1 's 100 greatest rock and roll album list first the beatles then madonna now the beach boy i wa stunned by the beauty of what i heard on quot pet sound quot the beach boy go beyond their traditional surf sound by exploring the sound of pop and rock quot pet sound quot is the band 's quot rubber soul quot a noted in the liner note maybe not in those exact word but that is what brian wilson wa aiming for and he got the result what he wanted the song are simply amazing next to the beatles' quot rubber soul quot and quot revolver quot i have n't heard music a pure a quot pet sound quot all the song took my breath away especially quot god only know quot and quot sloop john b quot quot pet sound quot also make for a wonder summertime album to listen to so carefree and easy going to listen to a real rock and roll masterpiece 

is the greatest 34 rnr 34 album ever made a 24 year old genius put together the most symphonic piece of 34 ear candy 34 and the label just dumped 34 sand 34 on it and washed it out to sea this is the most under appreciated album a real tragedy brian wilson became rock n' roll 's first artistic martyr 

it 's pretty tough writing a review for an album where it appears that everything that can be said about this album ha been said however if brian wilson had that attitude about songwriting before doing quot pet sound quot then we would n't be listening to it right so here 's my two cent if you have the mono mix of this album it is worth the extra money to upgrade to this cd the stereo mix brings out the boys' voice to their fullest it will fill up you car or your home stereo much better than the mono version pop or rock music can be sophisticated but still be accessible attract new generation of music fan and reward repeated listening like quot pet sound quot if you were to believe the critic of 2000 you would think that quot kid a quot by radiohead just passed quot pet sound quot in the music department do n't believe it in another 35 year quot pet sound quot will still be revered and loved by new generation while quot kid a quot will probably be looked at with disdain a pompous monstrosity much like the the work of emerson lake and palmer are looked at now in '00 oh yeah the music on here is great unlike their earlier hit which are badly overplayed on the homogenized baby boomer oldie station the song here never seem to get tiresome it 's kind of like a hazy summer day at a tropical beach with dark thundercloud on the horizon at least for me any fan of rock or pop music should have this cd in their collection without question once you have it the recent brother year compilation 1970 86 will make a fascinating bookend for quot pet sound quot it doe show that quot pet sound quot dwarfed nearly everything else the beach boy did afterward even though there were some interesting stop along the decline 

i feel that pet sound is a listenable and pleasant but marginal record from a listenable and pleasant but marginal band first the good news there 's nothing a annoying a say little deuce coup or surfin' usa on this album and the four a side would n't it be nice sloop john b god only know caroline no are easily better than even some of the beach boys' stronger hit fun fun fun in my room do n't worry baby even good vibration nonetheless there is n't much to this record outside of the hit and brian wilson 's egotistical but enjoyable lament i just wa n't made for these time the rest sound silly and dated to my ear when wa the last time you listened to the title track how about let 's go away for a while i'm waiting for the day do n't talk put your head on my shoulder or you still believe in me the group 's lack of a good lyricist or instrumentalist hurt even further the beach boy could harmonize all right but harmony can only get you so far which is why the beatles simon garfunkel crosby still nash and the motown act are all so much better than the beach boy in addition to the harmony they also had interesting lyric solid instrumentalist and great melody to back the singing up i understand that this wa a big influence on sgt pepper 's lonely heart club band so it merit careful study for those hooked on '60 's rock a i am but there are other '60 's album that influenced sgt pepper 's freak out blonde on blonde aftermath the beatles' own revolver that are far better this sound distinctively like it wa made 40 year ago sure so do all the aforementioned album but they all have a timeless quality this one lack that leaf pet sound a a good bunch of a side accompanied by pure fluff all of that make it one of the most overrated record of all time 

this album along with contemporary forever change revolver sgt pepper 's ha always held a very special place in my heart these album like true classic never get old and even listening to them so many time over so many year these album always manage to reach me the sad thing about pet sound though is that unlike the other album mentioned above which have been mixed well and have sounded really good post remastering this album ha at best an average quality level of mixing which make it really difficult to get a very good sounding version of pet sound despite numerous attempt at trying to get this album to achieve it sonic potential if only george martin produced mixed this album i 've owned many version of this and prior to this release the best sounding version i 've heard wa an old made in holland stereo mix version which i have since sold and regretted a i 've yet to find trombone dixie anywhere else on a single cd version of the whole album a a bonus track like that version did i do n't have an sacd player and so i may update this later once i spin it on my friend 's player soon but even on a standard cd player this version while is very good with respect to previous release given the original mix is n't the best sounding when compared with restored remastered release of it contemporary mentioned above the cardboard gatefold packaging is very nice though and would interest collector of mlps release although strictly speaking this is not a true replica of the original vinyl sleeve also included is a 20 page colour booklet with all the lyric and a mark linett essay mofi did the best that they could with the material that they had to work with but this is certainly not a reference quality audio experience in short this release may just be the best version of the album that is currently out there but it is certainly not the best sounding mofi release still recommended 

undeniably the beach boy masterpiece this is an album that ha transcended the year and will still be played and enjoyed hundred of year from now brian wilson inspired by the beatles quot rubber soul quot album set to work along with some help from tony asher to create one of the most amazing pop record ever made the digital remastering is excellent these song sound wonderful and the 24 page book is great includes note by brian wilson load of photo track by track note and a 6 page essay by david leaf on the beach boy and the making of this album my version ha 3 bonus track quot unreleased background quot quot hang on to your ego quot and quot trombone dixie quot this album belongs in all good music collection 

it is mind boggling all the hype surrounding this badly overrated cd i like many of the beach boy big hit but this cd just doe n't cut it on the version i borrowed out of sixteen song only the four lead track would n't it be nice caroline no god only know and sloop john b are of high quality i know there 's an answer here today and you still believe in me are slightly captivating among the remaining song the problem here at least to my ear is that the song all have a similar arrangement not slow and romantic like surfer girl or warmth of the sun or fast and jumpy like fun fun fun and surfin' usa it all mid paced and kind of spacey with a strong lack of ooomph and too many special effect it boggles the mind how one television broadcast ranked this cd a the third greatest rock n roll album of all time geeze louise this album barely even rock there is a strong lack of guitar presence throughout this collection and way too many special ef fects it trudge along like a sluggish snail and you can hardly wait for it to end the harmony all sound the same after a while and brian hog most of the lead vocal the lyric may have some special meaning but that 's based on the fact that you have not fallen asleep listening to the music how anyone can compare this to even the weakest of beatles record is ludicrous in my opinion stick with a good compilation of the beach boy california girl help me rhonda i get around and other early hit will always remain classic and keep any party hopping i have three of them and they all work fine however when brian wilson attempted to get too deep and stray away from grooving surfer rhythm the result is a stony bore borrow it from a friend but save your money a this music just doe not cut the mustard 

i do n't know maybe it 's just that i'm jaded or maybe there just is n't enough there to really justify a limited edition 40th anniversery edition i wa really excited to get this but it mostly retread the booklet is virtually the same a the 1999 mono stereo release now that wa a big deal it merely add a paragraph by mark linett at the start about the 5 1 mix the cd is exactly the same a that 1999 release so that leaf u with disc number 2 which contains the exclusive pet sound video and the 5 1 mix well it turn out that much of the video portion ha shown up in other beach boy video and that which is exclusive is pretty lame the george martin segment for example ok it 's really nice to have a 5 1 mix of pet sound hell i wa in heaven with the stereo mix so i'm grateful but still the sound is rather anemic why no dts and the vocal are in the rear which is a bit odd since i originally wrote this i did find the dts version and it blow this away sound wise i'm not sorry i bought this pet sound is one of the true landmark lp of modern music and at least whoever control the beach boy music is making some sort of effort unlike what is happening with the beatles' catalog i e nothing so though i wa disappointed with this release at least there is some product for the beach boy pet sound fan to acquire 

no question one of wonder of the digital is the chance for a work like this to be remixed in stereo with an amazing soundstage mark linett deserves an award for the work he did with the multi track to this album i 've heard thing i 've never heard in the hundred time i 've listened to the mono pet sound putting the mono and stereo version back to back really show the aural difference for all that refuse to accept the stero version and consider it some sort of sacrelige hey you have the mono version but you are really depriving yourself this classic got a whole lot better for those of you that are beatles fan a well we can only dream of the beatles work getting the same treatment 

pet sound really is the great album that all the lame geek from bam and rolling stone and all the a r blowhard and industry junky say it is thats the bad news now here the good news clark the shark from ge say it good so go buy it and hear the true pure sadness and angst a thousand year before punk rock a it us pete townshend song for toilet paper this album really is the sh if you must want the truth or not i'll give it to ya it better than rubber soul that other ubbbeeerrr mid 60's album the two album that launched the great album war that would plague rock into the 80's and beyond even when pet sound start to struggle on side two and alittle on side one the pain and bitter life experience of brian wilson and his hate for his dad keep the listener riveted this thing is all good beyond classic if it doesn't make you cry then yer probobly some facist california democrat type who doesn't understand great art anyway a you claim you do buy it 

a great recording take the thought and feeling of the artist and creates with them a work that enables the listener to say i 've been there i know exactly what they mean for the 40 some minute pet sound play i am brian wilson the disc encompasses the full range of human emotion the wide eyed innocence of would n't it be nice isolation i just wa n't made for these time gratitude you still believe in me longing i'm waiting for the day infatuation do n't talk put your head on my shoulder insecurity that 's not me homesickness sloop john b envy let 's go away for awhile desperation god only know benevolence i know there 's an answer pity here today disillusionment caroline no and the devil may care ebullience of youth pet sound when someone tell me they 've listened to this and did n't like it i really begin to question their humanity everyone need a copy of this in their home 

this album wa made at the same time a sgt pepper and wa a unique because it ha mono or stereo version of the song on the album with different type of song pet sound is like sgt pepper except that the beatles had more unique album and on most of the song the beach boy sound like themselves instead of beatles album where the beatles sound different on different song classic beach boy song on here include god only know would n't it be nice sloop john b caroline no to name a few another bonus track hang on to your ego is great a well this is a must for any beach boy fan 

it 's true this is one of the best album of all time i'm not sure if i 'd call it the second best album ever rolling stone but it is amazing even though quot pet sound quot a a whole is great it 's the hit that really stand out which include quot would n't it be nice quot quot sloop john b quot and quot god only know quot but i also really like quot you still believe in me quot and quot caroline no quot other than being a classic among classic this disc also includes the bonus track quot hang on to your ego quot and the entire album is repeated in stereo on track 15 27 for all these reason i highly recommend getting quot pet sound quot at least you should see what all the fuss is about 

i can remember when my older sister a beach boy fan bought pet sound when it first came out in 1966 i asked her if it wa a good a their other one she replied that it wa too slow and that there were only one or two good song on it a a result of her negative assessment i did not listen to this album for over 20 year when i finally heard it i realized that my sister wa hoping for more surfing music what brian wilson gave the world wa a great pop album which show that a a composer he wa right up there with bacharach and lennon mccartney this album is understated there are few bell and whistle some of the best ballad have to grow on you but it is consistently of such high quality that it eventually becomes a favorite of most lover of pop music wilson 's production is amazing his writing just soar the vocal can make you swoon it is an album to discover and re discover again and again if you are looking for a rocking album you may be disappointed if you are interested in finding out that wilson could write pop music a well a jimmy webb mccartney who rate this a his favorite album burt bacharach definitely get this album and listen to it over and over amazingly it is one of the few album from the sixty that ha not dated at all it sound a if it could have been released last summer barely noticed at the time it wa released it reputation grows with each passing year a one of the greatest album of all time heartfelt moving gorgeous 

ha no one else noticed what amazes me about this one of my all time favorite album of all time the beach boy only sing on it they play absolutely no instrument on it produced by brain wilson phil specter they can make anyone sound this good at least the beatles played on sgt pepper lonely heart club band did n't they and golly gee paul mccartney did get so upset the way phil specter produced let it be 

this album is a classic masterpiece one of the best album of all time two thumb up five star a 

brian wilson envisioned this album a his masterpiece and he 's right this album showed a side of the beach boy we had not yet experienced song from the heart the tight harmony and a beauty that few knew they were capable ofall graced the mono groove of the original lp brian initially intended this album to be released only in mono so he could have more control over what the listener heard there wa a duophonic fake stereo version but it sounded just that way when the original multitrack master tape were found the process to create the stereo version wa painstaking but wa well worth the effort now those same master tape allowed for the creation of a new 4 1 surround version i say 4 1 because the center channel is not used for the most part but in the same way the stereo version added new texture to the sound so doe the surround mix while it may have it critic the combination of the surround sound and high resolution 24 bit 96 khz digital sound make for a new experience with this fine album hat off to the folk at capitol and to the engineer who did such a bang up job of making a great album even better for those who do n't yet have a dvd audio player the dts track is highly recommended 

the beach boy pet sound the complete album in stereo mono this is a beautiful and absolutely classic album this particular single cd version of it give u both the mono and stereo mix both are great i originally did not want to buy a bunch of individual album by the beach boy i wanting instead a good compilation but having been disappointed with the five disk history set i turned to the original album i had the old lp of pet sound many year ago and this cd is a revelation of brilliance and clarity i could not be happier with this cd and am glad that i wa not forced to buy the multi disk pet sound session in order to own the album highly recommended 

pet sound is without a doubt a wonderful collection of beautiful harmony and melody each song is an incredibly well crafted set piece individual masterpiece when heard separately the problem is when they are put together in this package there is a sameness to the song found in the heart of each song is a gentle haunting melody without an edge the song move seamlessly from one to another and this actually work to their disadvantage they just are not different enough from each other to be fully appreciated in this setting unlike smile where wilson is able to constantly surprise and amaze pet sound is a pleasent and sweet series of song i enjoy them but they create a sense of comfort rather than amazement 

like many people i did not discover what by many is considered the greatest rock amp roll album of all time until the beach boy had passed into the 'nostalgia oldies' genre what a tremendous loss for me i had heard for year about what a masterpiece this record wa and to be frank i only thought that music written by beethoven and mozart could earn that status boy wa i wrong brian wilson one of the strangest songwriter of our time ha penned something truly magical when someone like paul mccartney say that this is his favorite album of all time that certainly say a lot a many before have noted there are many reason why 'pet sounds' is great in fact there are a many different reason a there are different type of people but there is one thing that we all agree on this album is truly a phenomenon unto itself almost nothing compare to it all serious music lover will understand and agree and comparing 'sgt pepper' another great album but also the most overrated beatles' album to 'pet sounds' is kinda like comparing the first world war to the gulf war they were a different a can possibly be i in particular enjoyed both version of these song many wonder why they were originally recorded in mono when stereo wa widely considered the way to go brian wilson wa virtually deaf in one ear so he could n't even hear it stereo and therefore concentrated on the minor detail the thing which really made his production superior to virtually everybody in the recording business in short there is almost nothing i could add to what ha already been said about this musical masterpiece anyone who truly appreciates music and doe not go into listening to 'pet sounds' expecting to hear a bunch of 'surf tunes' will be surprisingly disappointed at first after a few listens however the true genius behind this audio treasure will begin to show itself and the more you listen the more you appreciate in other word buy open listen and enjoy repeat 

pet sound is one of those album that you just sit and listen to and say quot my god these guy were truly amazing quot brian wilson wa so far ahead of his time in regard to songwriting i do n't however recommend this album to everyone this album is not quot packed quot with hit but it is far better than most anything you would buy today if you are looking for a more radio friendly bbalbum go with the greatest hit vol 1 but if you have a little extra cash but this and see why so many contemporary artist believe that this is one of the best album ever made 

a caveat the 5 star are for the music 4 star for pressing re pet sound and ok computer capitol vinyl reissue these are better than the abysmal imo based on disraeli gear and tea for the tillerman back to black reissue both the capitol reissue of ok computer and of pet sound that i bought today are dead quiet and neither suffer from obvious digitalis they do not sound a if they were recorded using the cd a the source which many people have felt about the b to b pressing the lead vocal on pet sound is a tiny bit on the bright side though it may simply be more revealing of whats there and my system is extremely revealing and cut no slack in this direction but it 's not brittle like tea for the tillerman is in place in the b to b series comparing this mono pet sound to the generally well thought of 1999 mono cap reissue i am hearing slightly better defined detail and slightly increased bass the more distinct detail may proove to be an improvement or a detrement in the long run i have to get used to it before i 'll be sure which i prefer but i sure a heck prefer the silence of this vinyl to every pressing i 've ever owned of pet sound it just great to hear no distracting noise during the oh so many sublime moment that brian wilson created for u this pressing of ok computer is more dynamic than my uk parlaphone which til now ha been my preferred pressing i have never been wowed by any vinyl or cd of ok c it aint a sonic pleasure like the radio head lp that have come after it this doe not reverse that assessment of it sound quality the recording quality of ok c is what it is but this doe seem to be an improvement at least a bit certainly compared to the huge bummer that the back to black series offer and especially a many of u have been afraid that it foretold that this wa all the big record company were prepared to offer this come a a positive tasting of the capitol reissue water so at first listen i 'd say these will at minimum fill the void for those not having quiet or any copy of these title and perhaps bring some small improvement for those lacking pristine wlp 's or first pressing of course the rest of this series may be all over the place by comparison this is a very hopeful 1st sampling though 

this is pop music at it more beautiful a genial vocal work with the correct melody if quot revolver quot the beatles 's masterpiece wa considered the best album of the xx century i should say that quot pet sound quot is problably the natural rival for that album essential for any cd 's collection superb 

i 've always been deeply torn over pet sound for decade it ha been regarded a a foundational album in rock history and to some degree i agree with this brian wilson paul mccartney and john lennon were the visionary rock and roll artist who decided to write song about more controversial topic than surfing with girl and driving car fast and pet sound wa unquestionably wilson 's artistic peak so it would only serve to follow that the album should fall into the position of legend and it ha rolling stone logged it a 2 behind only sergeant pepper 's lonely heart club band in it 2003 ranking of rock 's all time best album so what 's the dilemma i 've always been deeply troubled by awarding the term legend to an album that doe n't meet with significant consumer response i know that can be dangerous because some album are so far ahead of their time that commercial success is n't ready for it some would argue that this wa the fate of pet sound but i'm unconvinced two song would n't it be nice and sloop john b hit the top 10 and god only know also wa a top 40 hit so the public still wa ready for the beach boy sound they just did n't buy this album in drove and therein lay my concern a band that wa a well established a the beach boy were not able to bring the public along with it a it progressed from hitmakers to serious musician and other artist have been clearly able to bring the public with them the beatles did it with sergeant pepper the rolling stone did it with let it bleed pink floyd did it with dark side of the moon and in this millennium green day did it with american idiot so most certainly a shift in lyrical topic can be navigated successfully without a total sacrifice of success i can accept that album sale were not a brisk for rock act in the mid 1960 's but pet sound charted a lower peak 10 than 10 of the 11 beach boy album that came before it lyrical shift are not just topical but timely and the audience of the beach boy wa simply not ready for this album so the question continues to rage and i still do n't see this album a a true legend 

i remember the first time i ever heard 'pet sound ' i wa sitting at a beach house in delaware just relaxing and i decided to pop in a copy of 'pet sounds' that i just purchased not too long ago at the time i shut my eye popped the cd in the player and entered another universe i wa moved to tear and it take a lot for me to cry this record completely changed my life it ha taken me forever to write a review on amazon for 'pet sound ' simply because i could n't quite find the word to describe brian wilson and the beach boys' 1966 masterpiece i still ca n't honestly but i'm going to try but first in case you do n't already understand the background of this record allow me to clue you in in the early 1960s the beach boy consisted of mike love brian wilson dennis wilson carl wilson and david mark this lineup released three record from 1962 1963 all consisting of fun in the sun esque song revolving around the surf sun car and girl these record symbolized the california surf sound mark left the group in 1963 replaced by original member al jardine although both were in the group at the same time it wa soon obvious that jardine wa going to dominate the rhythm guitar spot jardine had been in the group during it earliest incarnation but left in late 1961 to pursue dentistry only to return le than two year later with this lineup change the group slowly moved towards a more complex sound and added tighter vocal harmony in 1964 brian wilson suffered a nervous breakdown and stopped touring the group initially replaced wilson on the road with future country and television star glen campbell on the road but this wa no long term solution the group released one final album with the five piece 'the beach boy today ' before adding bruce johnston to the touring lineup a brian wilson 's replacement and a it turned out in the studio a well in 1965 the group released 'summer day and summer night ' which is perhaps the precursor to what wa to come a year later this record proved to be their best yet and showed the beach boy maturing a vocalist and lyricist but even in '65 nobody could have predicted what wa to occur a year later that 's the history lesson brian wilson wa the visionary behind this record and his vision shine through brilliantly here to say the least the vocal harmony on this record are otherworldly there are simply no word to describe just how brilliant 'pet sounds' is 'would n't it be nice ' 'sloop john b ' and 'god only knows' are the radio hit notice the quotation this really is n't a radio friendly record by any mean from this album but these are only part of the mystique of 'pet sound 'listen to the haunting harmony on 'you still believe in me ' and the creative use of sound by brian a honking horn brilliant mike love turn out one of his best vocal performance on 'that 's not me ' to those who say that mike love ca n't sing listen to 'that 's not me' again his vocal here are emotional and almost flawless and brian 's vocal in the chorus are also just brilliant i 've always loved the guitar sound in the chorus here a well the instrumentals are also great 'let 's go away for awhile' is a dreamy mysterious piece that feature none of the beach boy playing on it this includes brian wilson wilson arranges it and doe it perfectly but take note that he doe not actually participate in the playing i 've always loved the vibraphone on here this is a neat instrumental the title track is also quite imaginative featuring the banging of coca cola can for percussion the guitar sound on here is great a are all of the multiple percussion track this track is extremely complex and pack a lot into it for a song under 4 minute 'here today' is another fine performance by love this is a love song and it is probably one of the few track here besides the radio hit that the strictly fun in the sun beach boy fan could relate to while i 'll always prefer love 's vocal on 'that 's not me ' he still sings wonderfully here and should be praised for his vocal delivery and then there are the tearjerker 'do n't talk put your head on my shoulder ' is in my opinion the most beautiful piece of music ever found on any modern record of any genre period brian wilson 's vocal here are a close to flawless a one could ever hope to hear the string arrangement in the middle of the track are perfect and just suit the track perfectly hal blaine 's ever so light tapping on cymbal is just perfect for this track more so than any other track on the record this song creates a mood it 's slow romantic and thought provoking this may very well be the most perfect track ever put on tape and i mean that 'i just wa n't made for these times' is also mind bogglingly beautiful if you are n't moved by brian 's vocal delivery and the harmony contained in the middle section there is something seriously wrong with you or you are soulless 'caroline no' ha always been my personal favorite track on the record while it is n't the most beautiful song on the record it certainly could be on any other record brian 's vocal are gut wrenching and just perfect you can feel almost every emotion he is trying to convey you feel the heartbreak in his voice and it almost sting but it is also quite beautiful and the arrangement could not be more perfect the hit on this record are also perfect 'sloop john b' is an old folk song that bud travis had recorded a few year ago a had the kingston trio al jardine had the idea to put a folk song on the record for a balance brian at first reluctant agreed and radically altered the track for the record this song wa a radio hit back in 1966 and while i have read that the track is out of place on the record i could not disagree more i think the track is perfect here a it give the record a lighter track despite the song 's message being rather sad this song would have also fit perfectly on 'summer days' in my opinion 'would n't it be nice' ha been played many time and is still a concert staple for all three current touring lineup of the beach boy tony asher 's lyric here are great and wilson 's voice is also in top shape this song conveys a message of optimism and is a perfect love song and the ultimate record opener 'god only knows' wa one of carl wilson 's first vocal performance and it also remains one of his best wilson would perform this song in concert with the beach boy right up until his death in february 1998 the backing track is perfect and the harmony that brian carl and bruce johnston share on the track are just gorgeous lastly 'i know there 's an answer' could be interpreted a brian 's take on lsd it 's an interesting track and it doe surprisingly fit on this record the backing track is extremely complex featuring a tambourine a it driving rhythm it 's quite interesting it 's not a beauty like some of the other track here but it is certainly a very cool track the bonus track are also neat 'trombone dixie' appears on some addition portion of this track you can call them recycled bit would later show up on later album a backing track 'hang on to your ego' is simply the original version of 'i know there 's an answer' before mike love made brian wilson and tony asher change the lyric due to it obvious drug reference the year following 1966 would see some good time 'good vibration ' released at the end of the year would reach 1 the last beach boy track to do so in america until 1988 and bad time the shelving of the 'smile' album until november 2011 brian wilson 's breakdown the disappearance of the beach boy on the american chart but one thing is for sure 'pet sounds' is brilliant i think it is the greatest album ever made and it is probably also my favorite album ever made it is beautiful moving interesting complex intricate gorgeous and flawless it is very well engineered and very well played featuring some of the best session musician in the business including drummer hal blaine guitarist barney kessel and bassist carol kaye this record is a masterpiece that must be owned by all serious music fan i do n't care if you like the beach boy or not if you do n't own 'pet sound ' you do n't have a collection of music that is worthy of mentioning plain and simple word cannot describe just how brilliant this record really is million have tried to sing it praise like i am trying to do now but there really are n't word adequate enough to describe just how wonderful this record is this is more than a record it is almost a religious experience in it own right five star is not worthy of a record like this infinite star are needed to even come close to describing how brilliant this album is buy this album immediately if you do n't own it already buy it and prepare to be blown away by the sheer brilliance that is 'pet sound ' 

this album is universally regarded a the beach boys' masterpiece and who am i to disagree you might say that this wa the band 's peak but i would say that they actually peaked with the good vibration single after this but pet sound is certainly their peak from an album standpoint this album always rank among the top ten album of all time in any survey of critic and rightly so if you ca n't appreciate how great this album is i feel sorry for you 

for year i often read about what a wonderful album this truly wa i wa like million of others well acquainted with and highly admired the radio favorite would n't it be nice and sloop john b i often planned to purchase this cd but i never got around to it until a few month ago after watching vh1 's 100 greatest rock and roll album of all time i witnessed that after the vote of many fan and critic were tallied pet sound came in at an astounding number 3 only behind nirvana 's nevermind and the beatles' revolver and the additional commentary provided in the program concerning this release led me to thus conclude that this is definitely a must have it is interesting that both the beach boys' pet sound and the beatles' revolver were almost simultaneously released in 1966 these two work alone illustrated the evolution of synthesizing top notch songwriting and instrumentation with highly expensive yet very creative musical production lately a a longtime beatles fan on one hand and a a person who ha come to highly admire the genius of brian wilson on the other i have been comparing pet sound with revolver yes i think that these album are equal in greatness and significance however i have come to enjoy pet sound a little more even paul mccartney ha identified pet sound a one of his all time favorite and rightfully so throughout their career the beach boy released other work that have come to be noteworthy pop standard but never at the level of this one in a way pet sound wa and is a hallmark of both creative triumph and a series of what ifs and what might have beens to me there are now two great mystery in rock and roll history that will forever remain 1 how successful and well received would the beach boys' smile the highly anticipated follow up that never came to exist have been and 2 what if brian wilson had a prolific partner within his group just a mccartney had lennon 

pet sound is the beach boy masterpiece some kind of reply to the contemporary folk rock music trend at the time beach boy previous music had been mostly about summer sun beach and surf but finally brian wilson decided to get serious and write song about more deep and personal issue this album is considered among the best of all time and it did influent many others in the future the sound of this album wa very unique when it came out and it 's a beauty to the ear aswell folkish sound with the classic beach boy sound singing in voice after the beatles rubber soul wa released wilson wanted to reply to that and that 's what he did here in his own way ofcourse the music in the mid 60 's had changed alot from the early part it 's difficult to not comapre the two album though some people even rate this a the greatest of all album agead of rubber soul and abbey road i do n't rubber soul wa the most influentual album for rock music in the 60 's but abbey road is my favorite album i do n't think we should compare the album with each others actuall beatles is beatles and beach boy is beach boy the reason i 'll only give 4 star however is that i feel that there is n't enough variety on this album most song if not all were wilson pennned and most song are emotional midtempo or ballad with beatles there were atleast 3 diffrent writer on most album and the music they made at this time were more contemporary rock infleunted and most song sounded very diverse aswell and gave them many more hit then pet sound did which only had 2 big hit would n't it be good and sloop john b i'm not trying to take anything away from this album though it 's a very good album on it 's own right there are many good song here would n't it be good one of a few uptempo song here and a big hit aswell that 's not me and do n't talk are both good balalds i'm waiting for the day is a midtempo folk rock song let 's go away for a while is instrumental sloop john b is a midtempo song and also a major hit god only know is a great ballad and here today reminds me abit of good vibration based on the musical backround in the beginning and in the end it actually sound very much like eye of the tiger from survivor hang on to your ego is a uptempo song aswell with great instrument overall a great 60 's album worth your time with quite a few top hit that influented the contemporary music back then 

the best way to listen to pet sound according to brian wilson is with a pair of headphone in the dark that way you will hear every detail it is the detail within it it that make it so special and there is a lot here that will move you even beyond god only know and would n't it be nice both perfect song wilson ha created a wall of sound that is light year ahead of phil spector and that is saying an awful lot brian 's brilliance continued with smile complete or not reaching absolute pop perfection again with good vibration and hero and villain lightening ha struck multiple time in brian 's studio having the track in stereo is very special we are still waiting for that experience with good vibration and i get around except for the live version from 1964 i want to point out though that if you think that this is the only absolute materpiece from the beach boy though that you have a lot more listening to do there are ton of them friend 20 20 today smiley smile unfinished or not the list go on and on these album are so good and there are so many little known gem on them that i am starting to really think that the beach boy may have been even better than the beatles and i am a huge beatles fan if you want to be blown away get today and listen to all of the ballad all sung by brian music doe n't get any better than this 

people tend to glorify their rock and roll idol we think that genious is just a fitting a word for a tool album a it is for advance in heart surgery we look more fondly upon bono and bruce springsteen than we do our own father some pretend that rock can really save the world when deep down we all know it ca n't reason is not always the music lover ally myself included having said that i do n't find anything wrong with giving proper credit where it 's due so i can say without any reserve justification or apology that this album is perfect every note from the psychedelic piano rain effect of would n't it be nice to the sobering lovelorn caroline no it is amazing what we human can create i know there 's an answer seems to ask if there 's something more while brian wilson try to convince u he just wa n't made for these time sloop john b is one of the greatest single of all time and though i know i'm not the first to mention god only know a being the first rock song to mention god in it title you 'll have a hard time convincing me that i'm not the most dismayed that we 're approaching a time when mentioning god at all is taboo this album reminds u of a more simple time happiness joy and harmony these thing should have always been a part of rock and roll overall 10 out of 10 

first quot pet sound quot is not over hyped but it is anomalous to those who still see the beach boy a a garage surfing band or a barbershop quartet true their name lock them into an image are you listening kid rock but take the album on it 's merit shut off the light lay down and open your soul secondly this album is a quantum leap beyond anything else done at the time the beatles were gyrating into a red hot lds frenzy and the satanic majesty the rolling stone they still have n't grown up this album ha a calmer feel compare the angry red and glitz of quot sgt pepper quot or quot satanic majesty quot with the calming green and gold of quot pet sound quot the beach boy were making a farewell album to the sensible 1960 's before the fire storm came thirdly since this is a different album listen to it with an open mind try to pick out the musical part and nuance of the piece imagine brian wilson living two hundred year ago and writing classical music what would it be like would we place him between mozart and handel yes yes yes additionally listen to the word mike love would be a good wrapper but he is n't a poet asher is he life a word a quot logo quot rational speech to wilson 's music this is a spiritual disc quot god only know quot fourthly stereo stereo stereo 

everyone ha heard that this album is a classic and those unfamiliar with it may wonder why it ha such appeal briefly it quality might be summarized a follows 1 the inventiveness of it arrangement there are so many timbre and instrument used all working together to create moment of beauty the bass line in particular are worth noting a they so often help create sonic tension all of the musician used are top notch 2 the warmth and depth of the recording every groove sound like a canyon though without the excess mushy echo of phil spector 3 the dazzling vocal harmony the beach boy were known for them and here they reach new height 4 the sincere emotional depth of brian wilson you can practically hear him pouring his heart and soul into the project taking catchy pop tune and turning them into quasi spiritual moment 5 the belief inherent in such an unusual project that pop music can be something more than just dance or party music brian wilson conceived this a something of a quot teenage symphony to god quot i am glad this recording is available in both it original mono and it stereo form regardless of which you prefer this sound good with headphone it sparkle a the rich tone wash over you and it is important to hear the mono version for insight into how the record originally appeared if you like this music i also heartily recommend a box set called quot good vibrarions thirty year of the beach boy quot 

this album wa and is mccartney 's inspiration for the rest of his musical life and that is saying something brian pull out all the stop to make the teenage angst masterpiece and the song i just wa n't made for these time is the anthem for those of u that ca n't seem to fit in with the clique highly recommended for music fan especially musician casual bb fan should not start here get the greatest hit 

if fan stopped trying to play can you top this between the beatles and the beach boy sure rubber soul inspired pet sound which inspired sgt pepper's which inspired smile which inspired the white album etc so forth so on and who care the fact is that each of the aforementioned record wa a major musical milestone on the road from rock 'n' roll to rock from the concept of adolescent rebellion to young adult protest and from craft to art when one considers that all this happened in the space of about three year the spirituality of it is overwhelming 1967 wa the high water mark of the so called counterculture and these are it anthem pet sound is brian wilson 's first and most successful attempt to transform simple surf and car tune into chamber music audacious and yet hauntingly familiar pet sound work dynamically to present u with a uniquely artistic all american sound while not a seamless a sgt pepper's pet sound avoids the lsd fueled visionary pretentiousness of that beatles entry whether pet sound is a better album than sgt pepper's is impossible to say they are both glorious different enough each to stand alone and yet they complement each other being two view of the same musical landscape this pet sound release is rather unique in itself being two version mono and stereo of the same album there are some interesting variation in music and lyric sprinkled throughout the different version and with it 's variegated detail pet sound command your attention plus the hit just keep on coming thanks boy 

i have always liked some of the beach boy work but had never heard the much hyped pet sound until recently for thirty year plus now i 've read critical review in this magazine or that praising pet sound a the greatest album ever made hogwash would n't it be nice if some of the reviewer who try to outdo one another in lavishing hosanna on pet sound actually sat down listened to the album objectively and then wrote review that consisted of something other than a string of superlative i am not saying anything is wrong with the album but in my opinion it is not even their best work let alone the best album ever made i listened to it a number of time to see if it would speak to me in some mystical voice a it seemingly ha for others no such luck i find pet sound to be an enjoyable album on which the best track are would n't it be nice and sloop john b simple a that if you are a beach boy fan then you will likely enjoy hearing both the stereo and mono version of pet sound a presented here if you are not a beach boy fan though this cd is unlikely to make you a convert 

one of the truly hyped album of all time that life up to the lavish praise heaped upon it brian wilson wa a 23 year old who wa struggling to express himself in new aural form and made this masterwork somewhat surprisingly it flopped the liner note detail the reason kitsch cover no doubt automatic dislike of anything quot beach boy quot by those that would have liked it the most hippy it also paint brian in a glowing light a working alone without a songwriting partner like the lennon mccartney team or without a guiding producer like george martin that he wa such a young man working alone against the advice of his manager and created such a beautiful album is truly a testament to his musical genius the song speak for themselves and everyone should know them by heart 

i must admit a someone who wa not a real fan of the beach boy i always considered themselves to be a fun in the sun type of band however a i became intrigued by the beatles' sgt pepper lonely hears club band album i soon became equally intrigued by the beach boys' pet sound i soon learned that there wa a bit of a rivalry that existed between the beatles and the beach boys' from a creative standpoint it turn out that when the beatles released rubber soul brian wilson felt compelled to push himself to the creative max and the result would be pet sound which in turn inspired the beatles to do sgt pepper with pet sound i discovered wa an album that wa n't the typical beach boys' fun in the sun but an album that would prove to be one of complex instrumentation and be year ahead of it time this would be the result of the effort of brian wilson with some songwriting help from tony asher wilson incorporates probably one of the widest range of instrument that had been heard on any album in the rock era this includes string woodwind brass and a variety of percussion and interesting sound bicycle bell dog barking etc if one is to basically compare sgt pepper against pet sound sgt pepper may have stronger and more catchy lyric but wilson 's musical arrangement on pet sound have the slight edge for all practical purpose wilson incorporates a four piece orchestra for many part of this collection two instrument that really stand out on this collection are the use of tympani drum and baritone saxophoneone thing that make this collection so unique is you get two flavor of pet sound the first 13 track are the original track a they were recorded back in 1966 and released in mono in 1997 brian wilson would take those original master from 1966 and create a stereo version of those track which are also included on this collection this basically is a win win for the listener i found that i would appreciate the charm and originality of the mono recording while i could also appreciate how well these track sounded when converted to stereo each version brings a different listening experience you will hear a little more distortion with the mono version but that is to be expected there is also a bonus track that wa not included on the 1966 release called hang on to your ego here is a quick synopsis of the track would n't it be nice this is one of the more popular track it ha the classic beach boys' harmony this song is enhanced by the use of tympani saxophone and mandolin you still believe in me slight psychedelic feel the use of bicycle horn give this song some charm the music from the harpsichord clarinet and tympani are some of the highlight here that 's not me not a bad song mike love doe a good job on vocal here and glen campbell contributes 12 string guitar do n't talk put your head on my shoulder a gentle song highlighted by gentle vocal by brian even the use of the tympani is softer here nice string arrangement here i'm waiting for the day this sound like a cross between psychedelic and hawaiian sound the tympani and bongo sound great here but also ukulele flute and english horn sound good a well all will really give this a terrific sound let go away i never thought of the beach boy a an instrumental group but pet sound give u two instrumentals this one ha a nice soft classical music feel to it sloop john b here brian rearranges a cover of this traditional song there is a bit of doo wop in here the baritone saxophone is used well here brian and mike do a great job sharing lead vocal god only know paul mccartney still call this one of the greatest song he ever heard and with good reason this song is perfection carl wilson get the nod to lead the vocal here and doe n't let anyone down the french horn baritone sax clarinet and string ensemble really help a well this song is lyrically very strong and probably the best song done by the beach boy i know there 's an answer mike and alan jardine share vocal here some more strong lyric more of a doo wop sound and more terrific baritone sax work here today great horn arrangement highlight this song especially the baritone sax i just wa n't made for these time lot of interesting percussion sound on here the tympani and baritone sax stand out here again pet sound the title track and another instrumental wilson admits to this having a james bond psychedelic sound more baritone sax and percussion caroline ho the train sound and the sound of brian 's dog barking at the end of this song are most remembered there is some nice ukulele on this song brian doe a great job on the lead vocal but great harmony by the beach boy hang on to your ego this is the bonus track baritone sax is the highlight here again however brian 's vocal might be the strongest of any track on this album the liner note are incredible you get a short letter from brian wilson about his perspective on pet sound david leaf ha a two terrific write ups one is more of a biographical point of view of pet sound while the other talk about the making of the pet sound album there are track by track note that include commentary by brian you also get a sessionography of all of the participating musician in pet sound pet sound might not be the best selling album in history but it most certainly merit it place in music history highly recommended 

with pet sound the beach boy or rather brian wilson with the rest of the beach boy in tow pulled off one hell of a feat the album is a pop masterpiece a collection of little ditty that command the emotional impact and inherent grandeur of symphony the song are n't performance so much a they are work of architecture a series of sound construction that are executed with an uncanny amount of artistic finesse the album make use of densely layered instrumentation incorporating an endless array of horn string keyboard guitar and percussion to create a set of lush colorful soundscapes the thing is the music never sound pretentious or forced in the hand of wilson and his endless army of session musician these gorgeous musing sound like the natural outcome of song like california girl or in my room it 's either genius or something very close to it and really there is n't a bad song in the whole bunch would n't it be nice is an absolutely glorious album opener a sun splashed rush of passion and yearning brian 's and mike love 's vocal are stunning in their emotional directness god only know is quieter but no le poignant it dizzying swirl of percussion and dreamy vocal harmony are just plain hypnotic sloop john b a cover of a classic folk song ha some great harmony and an infectious melody let 's go away for awhile and the title track are a couple of dizzyingly complex instrumentals that are among the dreamiest and most evocative work on the album you still believe in me is a stately dreamy piece of chamber pop while i'm waiting for the day is a wonderfully optimistic ballad that 's not me i know there 's an answer and i just wa n't made for these time are fantastic evocation of youthful alienation and angst while here today and caroline no are equally effective portrait of lost innocence and love gone sour there 's also do n't talk put your head on my shoulder one of the most achingly beautiful ballad ever created the chorus will make your heart melt so yeah good stuff pick it up 

i love the beach boy a much a anyone let me say that again i love the beach boy a much a anyone by that i mean i love the beach boy who actually live up to their name singing about the beach girl surfing car and rhonda this is not the beach boy it ca n't be why no beach song i thought it wa some kind of joke all quot pet sound quot offer is the opportunity to hear brian wilson whine for forty minute backed by elevator music there 's barely any mike love on the album at all way overrated 

the only way i could write anything about this album that ha never been written before is by writing what it mean to me personally i waited until i wa approaching middle age to become a beach boy fan when i wa younger i thought beach boy music wa trite and dated but when the new remastered two fers started being released i started buying them and enjoying them a lot not only wa the sound quality superb but the music described the teenage year that i and i suppose many others wish they had in their past but not reality i wish i had a hot rod in high school but i did n't i wish my summer were so care free and fun filled but they were n't beach boy music allowed me to escape into a past i never had and wonder what it might have been like it made me happy and sad at the same time then i finally discovered pet sound i could n't believe it the beach boy were actually singing about reality and even my reality the song i just wa n't made for these time seemed like it wa written just for me they say i 've got brain but they ai n't doing me no good is the story of my life or at least it seems that way sometimes the song i know there 's an answer describes so many people i 've encountered in my life caroline no reminded me of a woman i knew in high school who wa beautiful and always smiling and happy but when i met her at a reunion she had become bitter and her beauty seemed to be gone could she ever get it back that 's not me reminded me of my attempt to succeed in the fast paced world of consulting when i got out of college i had a great job compared to many people and i worked in some great city that i never would have seen otherwise but i discovered the hard way that that 's not me these song and the others are woven together into a pop music symphony that never get old though i will say that i listen to it much more often in the summer than in the winter 

pet sound is one of those album that occasionally is released that ha a jekyll hyde existence many people either hated it or did n't understand it while those who saw the evolution of rock into art realized that this album wa helping direct that evolution a always in everything from movie to book the difference between art and entertainment became a huge factor in the album 's initial commercial lack of success there wa nothing like pet sound when it came out furthermore the music wa very different from what the beach boy had done previously a recipe for commercial disaster long time fan of barbara ann and surfing u s a wondered what these song were all about this stuff just wa n't the beach boy they knew little did most fan know that the beach boy they knew never were the beach boy they thought they knew it wa n't until many year later that the complex relationship and creative conflict between the member of the group were brought to light and the discovery that brian wilson in particular wanted the group to grow in a more mature direction pet sound wa a very long step in that direction we look back on pet sound from our next millenium perspective and want to say what 's the big deal it wa a very big deal in 1966 pet sound and sgt pepper sparked a whole new revolution in rock music the effect of which can never be fully understood or estimated these album were the sound of rock music growing up however pet sound wa too alien for the typical public taste at the time and it flopped but other musician loved it particularly the beatles john and paul recognized the root of something great and were strongly influenced by it many other rock and pop musician have pointed to pet sound a being a big influence on their music pet sound wa music a art sgt pepper while also striving for art also managed to be commercially successful however there are song from sgt pepper which followed well the artistic path of pet sound that had their own detractor unfortunately not everyone understands art listening today pet sound is somewhat dated however listen to it over and over and you realize that the music is well done from our perspective we can look back over 25 year of rock music and realize that pet sound wa ahead of it time in all the hysteria of the beatles pet sound got lost pet sound is great rock because of what it wa when it wa released and who it influenced beyond the influence there are some really great song on this cd sloop john b is one of my favorite beach boy song would n't it be nice that 's not me i know there 's an answer god only know caroline no all very good to great song admittedly somewhat mellow but beautiful should you buy this album well depends on what you like pet sound refuse to fit into a nice niche it 's not like what the beach boy did before it it is mellow but it 's not a perfect fit into pop music if you 've heard at least 3 or 4 of the song above and like them then you 'll like the rest of the cd if you have n't heard very much of the cd then either download sample or borrow a copy i on the other hand may need to purchase another copy because i think the laser diode is knocking too many molecule off my copy i play it so much note that this album ha been reissued and remastered and thus this particular version is now the old version you may want to see what feature are available and the price of other version before you buy good luck 

surely one of the great album of all time brian wilson used his troubled genius to unsurpassed effect pouring heart and soul into this collection of 13 masterpiece in the beach boy he had at his disposal an incredibly skilled vocal group whose voice could blend and mix in the empathetic way that only come from a family group who have grown up singing and who were also perfectly capable of recreating the core of the album 's sound in live performance brian wilson had worked hard for the group for several year composing many of the song singing lead arranging the harmony vocal playing bass guitar and piano and honing his production skill which were greatly inspired by the work of phil spector he used the same pool of musician and occasionally the same studio in hollywood and like spector he wa an innovator and pioneer who could brilliantly combine unusual pair or multiple of instrument to create a unique single sound it all came together on this album by which time he had retired from the touring group to concentrate on his composing and record making the beautiful melody and the pet sound he created were matched by some exquisite lyric that were written in collaboration with tony asher and other writer brian wilson had been inspired by hearing rubber soul and wa fuelled by an ambition to match it in which he wa wholly successful in turn pet sound inspired the beatles to go on to create sgt pepper it wa this spirit of competitive creativity that led to his unfortunate burn out during the creation of smile his response to sgt pepper although not exactly a concept album everything wa recorded specifically for the album apart from the traditional song sloop john b which had already been released a a single and wa included on the insistence of the record company it doe not sound too out of place the first single from the album wa the heartfelt god only know what i 'd do without you this got to number 2 in the uk but suffered in america from lack of radio exposure by nervous radio station who began playing the flipside instead this resulted in would n't it be nice surely an a side in it own right anyway reaching the u top ten the title song pet sound is an instrumental that wa originally called run james run inspired by james bond and when heard with this in mind take on a whole new meaning for the listener the closing track caroline no end with more pet sound brian 's puppy banana and louie barking a the song fade this had also come out on a single before the release of pet sound but under the name brian wilson and without the beagle and weimaraner or other sound effect of course the original album already resides on everyone 's cd shelf in mono brian wilson wa deaf in one ear and so preferred to work monaurally again like phil spector he also felt that he could present the sound to the listener in exactly the way he wished without interference from any stereophonically knob twiddling listener however a stereo edition wa produced and engineered by mark linett in 1997 for the pet sound box set created under the close supervision of brian wilson himself and this edition follows the original album with this scrupulously remixed true stereo version not only are these version often slightly longer the additional clarity afforded by the sound separation add a whole new dimension to hearing them and take away absolutely nothing technological improvement since 1997 have meant that the new stereo mix of would n't it be nice on this edition is le different from the original mono mix than on the box set 

much ha already been written about this masterpiece one of the greatest lp in the history of pop rock two thing about it in particular that i appreciate one is that it demonstrates what imaginative studio production can be capable of so many record today by contrast are overproduced or simply badly produced that they sound immediately stale this by contrast sound a fresh a the day it came out the other thing about pet sound that i love is that it while not quot soul quot music per se is a record with much personality and soul and show the value of introspection when one is a musical genius like brian wilson the man who is mostly responsible for this 

in this modern day and age it easy to pinpoint the relevance of music album because of their place in history however what 's truly difficult is to consider those album to sound a fresh and innovative a they were at the time of their release pet sound however make it seem like the easiest task in the world this is the case because superficially pet sound is the first and main point of reference for the wide scope of innovation to come out of 60s' pop it seems everything the 60s' had to offer to pop music were synthesized within the album from the innovation of earlier craftsman like phil spector and burt bacharach the growth of the baroque pop aesthetic and the california sunshine scene all the way to the upcoming of sgt pepper late 60s' american psychedelia and the chamber twee pop revival in the 1990s' to which this album wa heralded a a rosetta stone sure to must pundit this is all very possible to point out without even listening to the album but once you get to listen to it with the first listen it sound a nothing the beach boy had ever done or would do again to be blunt the album easily trash out the boys' entire previous catalogue making it seem a if nothing wa even listenable before pet sound this is of course not the case the point being that the album is at such an elevated high from the already good album of the rest of their catalogue thats also not to say that this is a different style than their previous album it just that every element of the boys' music wa not perfected up until pet sound their classic vocal harmony are present but wilson multi layer them into angelical synchronization the pop hook are still there but wilson adorns them with subtle juxtaposition of varied orchestration within the same song the teenage melodramatic mood well in pet sound it is transformed into timeless yearns for love reciprocation and meaning see the pattern that emerges the one thing thats truly radical from the boys' previous input and arguably what give pet sound it sublimity is the instrumentation no longer are the boys' reliant on just blue chord progression piano surf like guitar hook and saxophone here and there this time wilson is able to integrate the grandeur of his best song like california girl and do n't worry baby into a full fledged album and not only that he us an full set orchestra to conceive it this is not just your typical string and brass however wilson go all the way with timpani french horn vibraphone and harpsichord among others he even go beyond orchestral instrument and brings in ukulele hammond organ hawaiian percussion accordion hell you name it it just like one critic pointed out the single from pet sound where the only time the boys' met commercial success while being endlessly experimental the song are a varied a the instrumentation a well you have the sunshine like opening of would n't it be nice the hauntingly sad do n't talk the superficial fun of sloop john b and the anthemic god only know just to mention a few example hell there are even a couple of instrumental track a la martin denny be certain of one thing there are no high point and low point in this album it all flow majestically like vintage wine from beginning to end even though pet sound is a mono recording stereo listener do n't stop reading yet brian wilson unmistakably manages the production output into an elaborate wall of sound alike work that is to say it is essentially mono but the recording process of the orchestration are in no way lessened to be honest i thought at first that it wa a stereo recording because i can notice the difference with some of the boys' previous record in which the instrumentation could sometimes be unbearably washed up and it also a bona fide experience to listen to it in mono a brian intended it to be however if you 're really into stereo there is a stereo version of the album included past the bonus track hang on to your ego to conclude i believe that if you 're going to buy just one 60s' pop album in your life then let pet sound be that choice i mean sure you could pick up one of their much rivaled beatles album but not even sgt pepper match the ornamental beauty of pet sound the beach boy one true magnum opus although i am yet to listen to the smile session so who know if there 's a contender 

judging by the number of review just on amazon this album is still impressing and affecting people after 30 year a good sign that brian wilson must have tapped into something that people identify with according to brian and i'm paraphrasing forgive me through the music he wanted people to feel loved and there is that here in the joyous strain of quot would n't it be nice quot with probably one of the most famous opening drumbeat in pop history and quot you still believe in me quot but there 's also a lot of longing loneliness questioning and disappointment between the groove all complimented wonderfully by the atmospheric and ethereal arrangement played mainly by brian and session musician this is probably one of the first and finest example of a true studio creation a concept album where all of the track seem of a piece even the lyric have grown past the car girl and surfing intentional or not quot god only know quot ha deceptively simple verse that double back on their meaning quot i may not always love you but long a there are star above you you never need to doubt it i 'll make you so sure about it quot maybe it doe n't come through just reading it but that 's about a close to poetry pop music come in my opinion the second verse doe the same trick even better two evocative instrumentals here a well i think it 's futile to compare this with quot sgt pepper quot though many people do let each rest on their own merit and remember quot pet sound quot came before quot sgt pepper quot the beach boys' quot rebuttal quot wa going to be quot smile quot the project that never made it way to record a a whole a lot of people helpfully say quot if you like so and so then you 'll like this quot but i think this is one of the few record that anyone who love pop music or heck even quot music quot in general should have in their collection 

your illustrious seer is at the beach now the warm sun and ocean breeze are invigorating the white seagull circle overhead watch out and i have been busy all afternoon trying to build a summer sand castle for myself meanwhile sweating to death in this seer 's cape they said the fabric breathed and would be good in all temperature they lied and aside from all that just when i get the sand castle to a stately form some freckle faced red headed bratty boy come around and knock it down i threatened to report him to the society for the prevention of cruelty to seer however an ice cream cone made him go away dealing with guido ha made me very adept in any situation now if only the tide would stop being a threat ah well anyway i am in the perfect setting to examine the reward of pet sound by the beach boy much ha been written about this seminal album and why not it consistently rank in the top 10 pop rock album of all time and rightly so if you ask me of course it wa n't greeted ethusiastically when it came out at least not a much a their prior hit brian wilson took the hit most of all probably unjustly but time ha proven that it wa the right move and the right time to most perhaps a little early and maybe they would say the wrong time but i would have to disagree with that brian wa ahead of everything on the scene at that time he saw that the music wa changing plus artistically you can not stay in the same place artistry need real growth meanwhile the other beach boy needed more hit and this is why the chasm happened but let get into this a little more the beach boy were and still are the ultimate summer group song about california girl fast car high school life requited love and teen angst angst angst these song were incredibly successful but brian knew that a he got older his audience were also doing the same thing he wanted to try a new direction and add some sophistication looking back to 1966 this album is a monumental achievement and remains so until this day sure some may downplay the importance of this recording however that cannot eliminate the fact that it wa a monumental change that influenced the musical landscape at that time forever it is essential and one of the very best but getting to the main point brian wilson wa moving towards greater musical compostion and more adult and inner emotion on record this wa a mega step and quite a risk at the same time most of the music is lush well thought out and instrument used precisely to get the right nuance that bounced around in his mind certainly the song are confessional i e you still believe in me emotional i e that 's not me i'm waiting for the day and quiet heartfelt romance i e do n't talk put your head on my shoulder one must of course listen to all the colour and passage in this music all these song have a way of revealing certain mood that marry the music perfectly beautiful lilting break shifting meter an array of musical instrument heretofore never thought of in the pop rock genre excellent and song we are treated to different but essential gratuitous hit with would n't it be nice and sloop john b but more than this brian give u 2 more considerable high standard gem yes we get to god only know which i nominate a the most beautiful song ever written in the course of popular music grandiose glorious i am fairly convinced that a higher power is somehow behind this remarkable song sweet yearning beautiful beyond compare angelic vocal a well if anyone doubt brian wilson 's genius have them look to this song absolutely the highest gem then we get to the wispful caroline no brian reflects upon how time can change a relationship he look back to a time when his love wa new and exciting and wonder why she changed where is the girl i used to know he hurt badly from the change and yearns for a return to a satisfying relationship knowing full well that it ha changed forever listen to the end a train in the distance approaching at a rapid pace getting louder and then quickly passing by a dog bark in the distance urging it return but it gone and then silence what an incredible conveyence of mood this is for the ending superb in a way the outtake of i know there 's an answer entitled hold on to your ego to me conveys the frustration brian wa going through in order to have the other member of the group in compliance with his new direction but he know he 's alone and he know that he 's going to lose the fight well he may have lost it to them however he won the classic album and we are all so much better that he did now i must go and make sure that kid is n't planning some new attack on my new home i do n't want to lose the fight anymore than brian doe in conclusion a classic and a must have in any considerable music collection goat say feed me seer say read me yours metamorpho 

i get something different out of this cd every time i hear it for me the mark of an outstanding record when something new still pop out of the speaker after three year of listening well i know i'm hearing one of the all time great i get the most out of pet sound on headphone take a walk on the beach at dusk with this cd at medium volume so you can hear the music interspersed with the crash of the surf and the cry of seagull the music fit right in brian wilson absolutely capture the outdoor beauty of southern california in 13 heavenly song i wo n't get into the sgt pepper pet sound debate they 're both masterpiece let 's just say both band pushed each other to new level of aural beauty a quot race quot that ultimately drove wilson into seclusion one of pop music 's finest 

when i wa 21 or 22 one of my coworkers dropped a copy of pet sound on my desk and said listen to it it 'll change your life well like anyone that age i assumed he 'd be wrong but one late night year later i did listen to it so anyway he wa right it changed the way i thought about music at a minimum since then you might say my obsession with the beach boy is complete the album 13 track of just incredible lush essential music much of it is brian singing lead and he doe so magnificantly in either a tenor range or falsetto depending on the piece where there 's harmony they 're sometimes drier than the previous stuff sometimes a lush and well arranged and sometimes there 's none a far a the song go there 's not a bad one highlight change for me over time right now you still believe in me do n't talk and god only know are my favorite but this change over time they 're all quite brilliant though every time i listen to the album i'm amazed how good it is from the fragile lead vocal in caroline no the brilliant layered tag on god only know the mighty chorus of sloop john b there 's really not enough room in any one review to say what there is to say about this this is an album about growing up about seeking adulthood it leaf behind the childish theme of the older beach boy material that ha maligned their reputation for a more mature viewpoint if you have a view of the beach boy and have not heard this like i did before i heard it you 're missing out if you do n't give this a chance i come from a jazz progressive rock avant garde background and while i had my own impression of the beach boy i learned how wrong i wa essential if you do n't own this you should this may be the best pop album ever written 

count me in among those who simply never got this album or at least never got it like those mojo critic who voted it in a the greatest album of all time or the r panel which put it at 2 it 's good yes but a magically mystically transcendent and shakespearian worthy reflection of the human condition hmmm many of the track seem overly sweetened to these ear especially you still believe in me i'm waiting for the day here today the chamber orchestration applied to god only know still work largely because the melody is so timeless along with would n't it be nice the title track and caroline no it 's the best thing on the disc wilson 's lyric are ok and certainly more sophisticated than anything the beach boy and most other pop act were capable of in the spring of '66 but even the best here i just wa n't made for these time caroline no are written from an overly sentimental perspective oddly enough though i enjoy do n't talk in spite of or maybe even because it 's a simple romantic ballad the repetition of the chorus at the end creep up on me and sends shiver down the spine pet sound never truly grabbed me until i heard the stereo version prepared for the box set and which is included here this version brings out the album 's delicate arrangement much more and to me is the only true version i expect a lot of disagreement here of course anyways i 've listened to and pondered it worth dozen and dozen of time hoping that eventually something would magically click and i 'd be enlightened which is how a lot of people have described their coming to love the album with me though it ha been more of a gradual appreciation a lyric here an instrument there and especially hearing the stereo version than a sudden impulse to erect a brian wilson shrine in my bedroom i 've heard the smile material on boot and it is the wacky wildly experimental stuff there which seems more like what i 'd expected of pet sound still i would recommend the album to anyone who ha n't heard it for it is still an essential work in the history of rock albeit slightly saccarine and sentimental in place for heartfelt lyricism and stunning arrangement without dross like sloop john b i 'd recommend rubber soul robert wyatt 's rock bottom joni mitchell 's blue or the kinks' village green preservation society instead 

a a landlocked kid growing up without ready access to beach or a car i had a hard time relating to the beach boy their celebration of sun surfing and hot rodding were too removed from my own experience it wa n't until i got older that i appreciated them song that had once sounded frivolous suddenly revealed multiple layer of emotion which had previously eluded me mind you that wa n't true of every beach boy song but classic like surfer girl and do n't worry baby were wistful and beautiful evocation of love and longing both questioning and reassuring brian wilson then outdid himself with his composition for the landmark 1966 album pet sound their apex and finest achievement and arguably the greatest record ever released by an american band paul mccartney ha said that if you have n't heard it your musical education is n't complete he further said it inspired the beatles to make sgt pepper i do n't really hear pet sound influence on that record but i do on abbey road especially on track like because and here come the sun king this cd contains the full album in mono and stereo wilson 's musical and vocal arrangement still sound stunning to this day if for any reason you 've resisted buying this you should n't at the very minimum any serious music fan should own pet sound and a good collection of their hit such a sound of summer 2003 wilson 's solo career ha also been of interest brian wilson 1988 wa a good one so wa the belatedly completed smile 2004 which wa originally intended a the follow up to pet sound wherein he proved himself to be a latter day gershwin smile collaborator van dyke park and wilson had previously released the excellent orange crate art 1995 recently wilson issued that lucky old sun 2008 another innovative song suite in the style of smile and it 's fine all are highly recommended whether you live in california or not do n't miss out on the beach boy and brian wilson 

a a reviewer i try to be rather conservative in my opinion to better aid the people considering buying said product but i think easily pet sound is the most deserving five star rating i 've handed out ever exaggeration and hyperbola are the standard in amazon review but everything i say about this release is both an accurate description and a heartfelt love originally a response to the beatles' rubber soul not only doe pet sound prof brian wilson head and shoulder above even the beatles if only for one album he quite beautifully demonstrates what can be achieved by the human spirit musically ceaselessly inventive with layer and layer of all sort of instrument and even a dog and a train however music itself doe not support the hype i 've said about the album here 's what doe brian wilson 's collaboration with tony asher who wrote most of the lyric for the album asher easily prof himself an incredible lyricist and the best collaborator for wilson 's vision what make pet sound so great is all the song add to a cohesion of both emotion spirituality and searching for the answer that the beatles never captured and maintained throughout an entire album and only distantly felt compared to this in their own right both album i am about to cite are intense in radiohead 's ok computer and pink floyd 's dark side of the moon this is the genius of pet sound it capture a stage in which we evolve the most youth not only doe it capture it pet sound recreates this stage and make it wonderfully relevant to our own life no matter how far from youth one is brian wilson and tony asher chart a young man 's voyage through his youth in only 35 minute this musical journey becomes both real and tangible becoming almost like a novel in it characters' complexity while it can be argued that this is only a collection of song that strip away much of the beauty and incredible vision that it took to make this album listening to pet sound is like watching your life unfold going through romantic idealisation to crushing heartbreak searching for god and your relation to him and a struggle to establish who you are and what you stand for while the dominant motif is romance you can take this a an allegory or analogy for anything a person truly love and the trial and tribulation one will encounter in a pursuing this love this facet is also what make pet sound so accomplished and beautiful it capture the pain of love whatever that love is whether it be in romance which pet sound chose a it dominant landscape or any other true love which is accessible to humanity every teenager should discover the truth on this album for it will greatly aid him her in their own love life pet sound because of the ascetic environment in which it responded too music largely simple with all these impossible romantic dream ala quot i want to hold your hand quot etc much of pet sound deal with romantic turmoil the opening track quot would n't it be nice quot show the young man in a very simple wholly naive belief about love and relation to the opposite sex then wilson and asher give u a study of this young man journeying from idealisation to crushing lost the unnamed quot i quot becomes so real by the end of pet sound that listening to the album in it entirety quot caroline no quot is so painfully intense after watching him struggle through so many thing in his own life because of the incredible buildup this is the single most powerful ending to any work of art let alone music that i have experienced when i said quot study quot one may think of a dry academic approach that only deadens what you really have an interest in and truly love have no fear when you listen to this you are constantly connecting to this person or person even that pet sound deal with the unnamed quot i quot anyone who will truly allow themselves to be open to this will find much of their own probing of life here and generally one cannot help but connect and identify with the young man in his quest for identity and a solution to life 's ever appearing question before i end this review to clear up my own viewpoint of beatles record in relation to this the three mid period album rubber soul revolver and sgt pepper are some of the best album ever made but simply cannot answer to pet sound the beach boy only truly significant album rubber soul is brilliant but doe not add up to any cohesiave whole a this doe wilson wanted to outdo the beatles after hearing rubber soul and in my opinion he did revolver one of rock 's most celebrated lp again lack the cohesion to that is required to top pet sound sgt pepper which after wilson heard it felt crushed and defeated and left one of rock 's most enduring quot what if 's quot by abandoning smile the follow up to pet sound which wa never finished let alone released while historically the most important lp we have sgt pepper is more an exercise in band psychology to truly stretch across and become the achievement pet sound is paul mccartney allowed himself the luxury of pretending to be in sgt pepper 's band and the only importance the quot concept quot of pepper had wa freeing mccartney up and getting the band away from their bubble gum identity while it ha a tremendous closing there is no magnificent buildup to what is an already powerful conclusion i consider pet sound the one piece of art from music that should enter the classical canon of twentieth century art it importance and relevance to humanity cannot be overstated and is one of art 's best epiphany and expression of human pain searching faith and endurance a highly recommended a possible 

the beach boy pet sound honestly i do n't get it i have tried time and time again to give the beach boy a chance and i just do n't get it i know it is good time music and summer fun but for the most part i really just think they are overrated and i feel the same way about pet sound i totally understand that it wa a landmark album and changed the way music wa recorded and the way it could sound but other then the production i do n't get it yes it inspired srg pepper by the beatles but so what so did freak out by frank zappa and the mother of invention and that doe n't get half the acclaim this doe i think 'god only knows' is a great song lyrically that is music wise i do feel the band could have done better the melody is smooth a ice though 'would n't it be nice' is hand down one of the greatest pop song of all time no debate i would even fight someone who dare say a bad thing about that tune i must say though that 'sloop john b' could have been better the title track is really awful to my ear 'here today' wa misguided 'caroline no' may be the best song on the album and it rarely is spoke about now i know everyone is gonna vote not helpful on my review just because they disagree with me i wish you would be open minded about where i am coming from though like i have tried to be time and time again with the beach boy before you click no i am just saying that this is not an album for everyone there for i do n't understand the claim that it is one of the ten greatest album of all time maybe someone could leave me a comment explaining it to me because i am not saying this is a bad album because it not but it is n't amazing either 

i bought this cd back in august and i have only listened to it once when i needed music to fall asleep to when there wa nothing on the radio i have heard that this cd is quot depressing quot but when i heard it i found nothing depressing about maybe it wa because i wa n't concentrating fully on it but i wa n't impressed maybe if i looked at the lyric if i could find them and found the true meaning of the song i would like it better maybe when i listen to it again i 'll give it a better review 

most and most likely all of the people who do n't like the beach boys' classic pet sound 1966 just do n't like the beach boy if you do n't like the beach you 're not gonna like surfing pet soundsis actually quite a remarkable piece of of work introspective and deeply personal the song are about life love and yearning not surfing and hot rodding on the strip the album is a symphony of sophisticated chord change wistful melody sweet vocal harmony and reflective lyric of love and longing the true genius of brian wilson realized the classic beach boy sound is n't completely lost here and it 's especially highlighted in the album 's first song would n't it be nice and in the sailor 's boisterous lament sloop john b but mostly the atmosphere onpet soundsis n't the usual fun day at the beach it 's quiet thoughtful and lonely sometimes i feel so very sadand i guess i just wa n't made for these timesconsidering this wa released in 1966 it 's an amazing accomplishment sir paul mccartney praised the album by saying no one is educated musically until they 've heard pet sound it is a total classic record that is unbeatable in many way there is another dimension topet soundsthat 's evident to people who were around in 1966 and remember listening to the album when it wa first released the loss of innocence the world wa changing fast in the 1960s and the beach boy represented good clean and carefree fun to a lot of people the melancholy spirit of many of the song onpet soundsseemed to be sadly saying goodbye to the endless summer of innocence in america and in many way it actually did could i ever find in you againthings that made me love you so much then could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone oh caroline no 

the beach boy experimented with this new form of psychcedelic sound on thier two 1965 lp the beach boy today and summer day and summer night with these two 1965 lp brian wilson and the beach boy were trying to create a new sound that at the time no other rock group had ever created in december 1965 after brian wilson had just heard the beatles rubbersoul a statement album from the fab four implying that the whole album should be counted a the hit not just a single or two off the album and the rest just filler brian wa amazed at the simularities between the just released rubbersoul and the beach boy earlier 1965 release today and summer day and summer night brian would say i want to make a record just like that but i want to make it better brians competitive fire were stoked to compete with the beatles and what brian wilson and the beach boy created blew the beatles right out of the water and rest wa history in fact the beach boy were so worried about pet sound being accepted by capital record they were prepared to be told to go back to the studio and make a friendly top forty record but defenintly please nothing like pet sound capital record were not so sure how the public would accept this new sound an incredible early psychedelic recording released may 16 1966 which influenced the beatles 1967 sgt pepper so much that george martin ha stated if it were'nt for pet sound sgt pepper would not have been created pretty strong word from sir george who helped produce the world greatest rock band music believe me when the beatles heard pet sound their jaw dropped with envy and anger 1966 wa a very musically transitional year for both the beatles and the beach boy at this time on aug 5th 1966 the beatles released their counter shot to pet sound with their masterpiece revolver many rockologists and beatle fan alike consider revolver to be a better recording than sgt pepper of course it will always be debatable and an ongoing endless conversation the beach boy were to add an exclamation point to pet sound in october 1966 a the beach boy unleashed their pschyedelic masterpiece good vibration just a few month before the beatles started their sgt pepper recording session the beatles were enjoying success with revolver and captured some of the new pschyedelic sound with revolver release even with the success of revolver the release of good vibration defined more of the psychedelic sound in rock music in the fall of 1966 than revolver did and really got the beatles crazy with envy and created a real urgency for the beatles to get back to abbey road studio to outdue their well armed rival the beach boy never approached the success of the beatles due partly if not all to brian wilson bad habit of over indulgance but pet sound really made the psychedelic era sound and influenced the beatles sgt pepper a the song say god only know what the beach boy could have done post pet sound if it were'nt for brians over indulgance in bad habit will never know pet sound wa recorded while brian had these bad habit but that is what helped pet sound sound unique brian let these bad habit get the better of him post pet sound pet sound wa not a commercial success when released but clearly got the attention of many music artist including classical composer leonard bernstien a their mind were just blown away by it i listen to both sgt pepper and pet sound and there is some really eerie simularities besides the instrumentation between the two on pet sound after caroline no the last song on the recording you hear a trolly and a dog barking and than a train with it horn going off and a dog barking while and after the train pass on sgt pepper you hear barn animal possibly pet sound influenced and on magical mystery tour you hear a train with it horn just before going into pennylane pink floyd would use animal sound in their 1970s work 1970 atom heart mother including a cow on the cover of the lp pink floyd in 1976 released an album called animal and even used giant inflatable pig on their animal tour stage show i wonder if pet sound had anything to due with that pet sound caused the beatles to disappear into abbey road for 6 8 month to make sgt pepper to make sgt pepper better than pet sound and good vibration because of this sgt pepper is the yardstick to measure every rock recording from past present and future the beatles also had the greatest record producer of all time on their side sir george martin john lennon paul mccartney sir george martin v brian wilson brian wilson wa on his own and had no real help even though the remaining beach boy had some creative musical skill the one thing i will give the beach boy over the beatles is that they had better technology in the recording studio than the beatles at abbey road i respect the beach boy and brian wilson tony asher a a song writer and music creator in my opinion the beach boy pet sound set up the pschycodelic era a really important era in rock history that even the beatles and most every other rock band during the psychedelic era copied pet sound in some form i like having both version of pet sound mono so you could hear how it sounded in 1966 and stereo because you could hear different instrument that you cant hear in mono i like the stereo version better because i am just used to stereo recording but i still like to listen to the mono version and go back to 1966 the 5 1 stereo sound is mind boggeling and must be heard on your theatre system you will not beleive pet sound could sound this incredible every song on pet sound is a an early psychedelic journey into the start of the most important era in rock history pet sound started the most important era in rock history the psychedelic era i recommend pet sound to any music lover this recording truly set the standard a definetly one of the greatest most influential rock recording ever created this cd mono and stereo sound pristine and brilliantly remastered the miniature booklet supplied with this 40th anniversary edition cd is extremely informative and the dvd is an incredible look into this historical facinating recording pet sound is a very influential and timeless recording pet sound is the blueprint for the entire psychodelic 1960s early 1970s which the beatles and many rock group of the time used the pet sound blueprint to mold and create their own music during this time if you the reader wish to get more into pet sound you should look into purchasingthe pet sound session you will with this four cd box set see how genius brian wilson construct his 1966 masterpiece if pet sound session is to overkill you will be making the right choice just sticking to this fortieth anniversary edition release 

why did no one make me listen to this album during my pop music college day it is wonderful would n't it be nice is now one of my top five favorite song a ranking that is very hard to get with me i love how it manages to be innocent and sexual at the same time i love the song sloop john b too this album is beautifully done both musically and lyrically definitely one to buy and listen to many many time 

brian wilson did thing that john paul george or ringo never even thought of everyone say sgt pepper shaped the way that pop music is today to those people i simply scoff and proclaim them a moron if you think this album is overrated then you probably think led zeppelin were a good rock band brian wilson did thing on this album that were n't being done at the time genius best album ever 

while the overall sound quality of capitol 's new dvd audio disc of quot the beach boy pet sound quot is excellent and the supplemental photo gallery video amp on screen lyric musician credit option are excellent remixer mark linnet admits in the liner note that his mix ha no center channel content which is acceptable given that his resychronzed vocal amp instrumental multitrack session tape give him 6 to 11 track to mix from for the album 's 11 vocal song only 3 or 4 track for the album 's two instrumental selection but i'm highly disappointed that there 's no subwoofer content and the front to rear separation is vague a for the album itself it 's a work of musical genius but then you already knew that the 15 minute video documentary is passable but it recycles mostly already released interview the debut of surround amp stereo remixes of quot summer mean new love quot an instrumental from the group 's quot summer day and summer night quot l p is included amongst the bonus track it 's impressive a is a surround sound accapella mix of quot i just wa n'tmade for these time quot be sure to play the appropriate side of this two sided disc one side is for genuine dvd audio video player the other side ha all the same audio amp video program content but for dvd video player without dvd audio capability the sound quality difference is real the uncompressed dvd audio ha superior resolution amp dynamic 

let me get this out of the way first i really do like this album always have and always will there are a number of killer song the usual suspect would n't it be nice caroline no god only know and the great song that were n't hit that 's not me i know there 's an answer here today i just wa n't meant for these time however a much a i like these song i do have to take issue with the legendary status of this record for me there is too much filler lush but relatively insipid ballad and unnecessary instrumental interlude i never particularly cared for sloop john b a for the concept aspect of the album well i do n't see it a few animal noise here and there do not a concept make is there a story tommy superfly or a common theme i know that teenage angst permeates the lp but surely is n't this the case for a great deal of the music recorded by guy in their teenage year and early 20 's and would someone please explain the significance of the title cover and the pet sound i am a subjective listener of music when it come to lyric i recall and sometimes sing along without delving too much into hidden or to be honest surface meaning i listen to the sound a a whole rather than analyzing instrumentation recording technique and the like although i do have a high end stereo system i am equally happy listening to music through decent headphone in the car or through my new wireless sony speaker however a i considered my comment on this album in light of the myriad glowing review i did listen more carefully i have to say that my objective listening did not lead me to a heightened appreciation of the music on the contrary i wa disappointed to discover that the more carefully i listened the more i became cognizant of flaw in the lp for the first time i realized just how pretentious precious and produced not over produced just slickly so it all sounded i did n't care for the surfin' music that preceded pet sound i have played and enjoyed the subsequent surf 's up and holland many time pet sound for me it is an interesting and self indulgent experiment is it revolutionary is it one of the greatest record of all time my answer is a pretty firm no on both count although it doe represent a giant step forward for the beach boy it 's neither a rubber soul nor a sergeant pepper 

realesed in 1966 pet sound by the beach boy is loved by critic and well anyone who like the beach boy pet sound is one of those album that are just not able to created ever again by this time brian wilson who had suffered a nervous breakdown while on tour with the beach boy now remains in the studio writing and recording new material pet sound show the band growth from there humble beginning to more complex song and much more greater album compared too there earlier one highly influentail album that ha even influenced the sgt pepper such classic a sloop john b and god only know remain classic song too this day album like this come around once in a lifetime pet sound is a pop rock and psychedelic album and explored brian wilson 's exploration of the drug lsd so what are you wating for the only beach boy album you will ever need buy pet sound todayyou wont be dissapointed 

pet sound is one of those album like sgt pepper born to run or exile on main st that have been reviewed and analyzed to death but the reason why it ha garnered so much critical attention is that it truly one of the most original and groundbreaking album in rock history brian wilson had spent the previous few year writing and producing magnificent single but had yet made a truly great album spurred on by the beatles' rubber soul and his idol phil spector mr wilson set about to make an album that raised the bar on what could be achieved on a pop album he succeeded on every level pet sound is one of the most literate intricate and lavishly produced album ever released the other band member were limited to just providing vocal on the album a mr wilson employed studio musician to provide the music despite this fact the band never sounded better a they provide the luscious harmony that make the song practically float out of your speaker the song were no longer about surfing and car but about more mature relationship and growing up quot would n't be nice quot is a beautiful song about wanting to get married that hit number 8 on the chart quot you still believe in me quot is an airy number about a woman standing by her man quot do n't talk put your head on my shoulder quot is another gorgeous melody and quot sloop john b quot is a traditional song that wa the album 's biggest hit peaking at number 2 quot i just wa n't made for these time quot is another brilliant introspective number from brian wilson and quot caroline no quot is a beautiful ballad that close the original album out and wa actually released a solo recording by mr wilson quot god only know quot is perhaps the most heartbreakingly beautiful song the band ha ever recorded and is the essence of the album carl wilson give his hand down best lead vocal and the song is a virtual symphony pet sound wa not a big hit in the u peaking at number 10 a american wanted song about sun and fun in the sun but in england the album wa a huge success peaking at number 2 and blew the mind of the british musician one in particular paul mccartney called it the greatest album ever made and it wa the beatles' inspiration for recording sgt pepper 's brian wilson tried to top pet sound with smile but that album wa never to be pet sound stand a the beach boy greatest album and one the best of all time 

many will debate whether or not pet sound is the absolute greatest album of the rock era but just about everyone agrees that it is certainly at least worthy of consideration if this album were produced today in 2004 we would marvel at the sonic quality the production magic the textural intricacy and the instrumental detail that it wa done in 1966 is mind boggling with pet sound brian wilson 's name wa forever etched in the pantheon of great composer and like fine wine this album just seems to get better with age the lyric combine wide eyed innocence with a knowing pathos that make each song quite moving the melody are achingly gorgeous and the harmony are positively celestial wilson 's choice of instrumentation is a bold a it is broad chime and sleigh bell and woodwind and brass and string augment the traditional bass drum guitar keyboard sound giving pet sound a lushness that ha seldom if ever been matched would n't it be nice is a joyous romp that launch pet sound on a very high longing note dazzling harmony highlight the ballad you still believe in me before the band swing into the highly personal uptempo that 's not me brian wilson 's romantic do n't talk put your head on my shoulder is amazingly intimate and then the mood shift once more for a romp with i'm waiting for the day the jazzy instrumental let 's go away for awhile lead into one of the beach boys' most beloved story song sloop john b a folky jaunty sounding song that tell a very sad and disturbing tale if pet sound is arguably the best album of the past 50 year then god only know is arguably the best song take a stunningly beautiful melody overlay it with instantly relatable and honest lyric and a bracingly innocent vocal performance filled with longing and the sweet pain that only love can bring and then wrap it in some of the lushest arranging and instrumentation ever heard on record and you have a song that is an enduring and beloved classic confession and hope imbue the next track i know there 's an answer with a positive refreshing sense of survival made all the more poignant now knowing brian 's state of mind when he wa working on pet sound and the subsequent smile the tempo pick up again for here today before cooling back down again for the heartbreaking i just wa n't made for these time a song destined to be brian wilson 's epitaph the title track is a cool exotic instrumental that sound like a surf tune arranged and orchestrated by nelson riddle with caroline no brian wilson take a very simple line where did your long hair go and spin it into a metaphor for lost innocence in life in relationship and indeed for an entire generation one find themselves overusing the word poignant to describe song on pet sound but is certainly is an apt word especially for caroline no the bonus track hang on to your ego is an alternate take for i know there 's an answer and it is enlightening when juxtaposed with the final version because of it 's cohesiveness musically and thematically pet sound is one of those few cd that virtually demand to be listened to uninterrupted from start to finish every time give it a spin and let it grow on you i used to love pet sound but now i consider it an absolutely indespensible part of my cd collection i seldom go anywhere without it 

like many other classic from it era pet sound simply ha n't stood the test of time not because it sound were n't ground breaking for when it came out but because most of the song really have n't aged well would n't it be nice and god only know are absolute classic but the best and best known of the remaining track sloop john b is n't even an original composition and there 's a reason that caroline no is probably the only remaining track that non owner of the album will have ever heard this album is far more important for the influence it would have on the beatles a a studio band than a a musical statement by brian wilson it 's certainly not unpleasant to listen to but the second greatest album of all time a recently selected by rolling stone magazine absurd 

for someone with at least a passing knowledge of most of the big name and album of the '60s i ca n't believe i had not heard of this phenomenal record until perhaps a decade ago then again it wa n't a certified million seller until april 2000 so i 've read how wa it possible add my name to the endless list of people who thought the beach boy were a wimpy horrible band that only american teenager of the 1960s could like only to discover that pet sound is superb or maybe we love it because it 's not really a beach boy album it 's a brian wilson album despite my reservation i finally picked it up a year ago about april 2000 come to think of it and wa floored it 's a gem from start to finish pretty much 'would n't it be nice' and the gorgeous 'god only knows' are familiar to even non fan like me but there are quality song all over the place in particular 'i just wa n't made for these times' the record would have been improved by omitting 'sloop john b ' a brian wished but a the suit told him hey we gotta have a hit song right the song is okay but it just doe n't fit here now good vibration oh well everything you 've read about wilson 's production is true it 's brilliant and sometimes over the top the vocal are stunning but i do not go along with the universal line that the lyric here are anything special there are some good one and they 're a helluva lot better than previous bb material but dylan had nothing to fear i ca n't believe that only 24 people have reviewed this disc so far it 's probably a manifestation of the phenomenon that ha surrounded pet sound from the start it 's better thought of in england a mojo poll recently nominated it the planet 's no 1 album than it is in the u strange maybe beach boy fan still do n't like it 

pet sound is an album that is totally beyond comparison to call it the best pop album ever is an understatement and also a little misleading this music is beyond categorization a quot pop quot it 's simply brilliant idiosyncratic music that being said there is nothing in the history of recorded music that even touch the sheer genius of this record every microsecond of sound is so carefully considered and perfectly arranged that the result is the most emotionally touching collection of song you 'll ever hear it is impossible to overrate pet sound it is unlike anything that came before or after nothing in the beatles' over hyped catalog even come close and anything that might be in the same general proximity is rightly credited more to george martin 's production than the quot fab four quot remember pet sound is the work of one singular musical imagination brian us the boy a quot instrument quot composed arranged produced assembled dreamed a a coherent whole this album should be heard by everyone whatever you believe your musical to be it is one of the great work of western civilization for u to study consider and enjoy beyond essential this version offer the original mono mix a well a a new stereo mix obviously it should be heard in the original mono to be fully appreciated but i 'll be the first to admit the stereo is really good offering a sense of spaciousness and natural sound that is hard to criticize it 's not a substitute for the original but a great addendum honestly the best version is the dcc quot gold quot disc which is mastered with such attention to detail that it ha an almost intangible like like quality not even present on the original lp but i own about 7 different copy and version of this album on various format and this quot two fer quot offeres excellent sound an value 

paul mccartney himself credit brian wilson 's pet sound a the muze for sgt pepper 's listen critically to the track and echo of pepper resonate from the melodious use of bass guitar to the masterful orchestration of these ode to teenage angst is pet sound better than pepper beside the point but without pet sound and the competition brian wilson represented to the fab four you may very well have a different pepper or perhaps no pepper at all you have n't heard genius until you 've heard pet sound it is an album for the age 

this time in 2 different mix authentitcity in the mono version and a stereo version for hi fi freak i'm over the moon about this one 

two essential beach boy cd 's are out the quot sound of summer quot greatest hit package the best beach boy compilation ever and the majestic quot pet sound quot brian wilson 's masterpiece wilson did n't tour while preparing this opus and used session player with the exception of the vocal after all nobody could harmonize better than his own band what he delivered wa a collection of the most beautiful pop music ever assembled on one album studio effect add ambience and a slight touch of the avant garde but the song themselves are the true gem quot would n't it be nice quot with it impeccable harmony and melody is one of the greatest song ever and wilson top that with one of the saddest but gorgeous song ever with quot i just wa n't made for these time quot the whole album is so good that it should go on forever reaching the ballad quot caroline no quot is a musical journey that doe not last nearly long enough thus guaranteeing this album 's playability for a long long time after buying it if another civilization were to ask me to give them one reason why this planet with all it hatred should n't be charred to a cinder i 'd play them quot pet sound quot maybe they 'd let u off the hook for a while 

pop album going back or forward in time let 's face it there is more to good song and music than youth oriented rock i wa in 8th grade when this album came out and always liked it alot and the funny thing is not until maybe 30 year later did i ever meet anyone who liked it much but i 've always been a big bboys fan quot god only know quot is among the finest composition ever and along with a handful of brian 's song deserves inclusion in the 20th century canon along with gershwin 's and kern 's best etc i heard a beautiful recording of this by a canadian child 's choir which sound better than the bboys beyond this most the tune seem to be about late adolescent angst high production value or not a one get into the middle year of life can anyone really praise quot would n't it be nice quot or quot caroline no quot to the sky they remind me of whining choir boy stretching to hit a note yes brian wa looking for a new sound at the time but on this record there is almost none of the fun and whimsy so obvious in their earlier work it 's true they were still very young mid 20 's probably when they did pet sound the song with mike singing the lead come off better like quot i know there 's an answer quot quot here today quot and quot i'm waiting for the day quot with the high pitched wilson brother doing the background along with their own surf up this is among the great late 60 's early 70 's pop rock album yes it 's up there with the best of the beatles simon and garfunkel and the byrd but 's let 's not go overly gaga on it brian another mozart or handel come on let 's not overdo a good thing 

one thing wa always clear when one discussed the most popular artist or band from the 1960 's the beach boy were near the top of each and every list and at one time in the 1960 's were voted the most popular band sultry vocal and harmony great songwriting about thing that most people in the u s in particular could understand and relate to being on the beach car and girl however brian began to want to explore more in music and draw on the rich and outstanding wellspring of musical genius he had within him this began to eat him up inside a the record label and those within his own band mike love in particular could n't nor would n't allow themselves to understand i 've heard many reason for his nervous breakdown but i believe this to be the catalyst this wa a man who wa hearing wonderful musical theme in his head and wa not being allowed the time space and creative freedom to explore and bring these theme into fruition on top of that the british invasion wa in full swing and those artist and band were bringing a fresh perspective on music both it 's recording and production to the world a well a the motown sound topping the chart with one great artist after another fate typically doe thing when least expected and fate saw an exhausted wilson being home recuperating from his breakdown at just the time the rubber soul album wa being released by the beatles it would be the album that helped to validate the direction wilson wa feeling his music and that of the beach boy should be going he found his creative second wind and with the help of friend and lyricist tony asher he begin to compose write produce and record the song that would become pet sound it wa truly an ambitious project and one that would change the face of not just rock music but music in general forever when his fellow band mate returned off of the remainder of the tour brian had left he had basically the entire project completed except for the vocal once the other member along with brian laid down their gorgeous vocal which a usual were one of the many strength of the album they had completed a true game changer and neither they nor the music world would be the same this album would inspire a whole host of artist to change their entire perspective on how song should be both written and recorded paul mccartney took a copy to john lennon and they listened to it over and over again until it became engrained in their thought process george martin their brilliant producer also wa listening to the album and it wa now the catalyst for what would become sgt pepper 's lonely heart club band funny how fate and destiny work is n't it bravo to you mr brian wilson i recently listened to this album from beginning to end and marveled at what wa produced you and mr asher created a masterpiece that truly changed the music world and more importantly validated your true genius p s here 's what others were saying about the album and brian wilson eric clapton stated that all of u ginger baker jack bruce and i consider pet sound to be one of the greatest pop lp to ever be released it encompasses everything that 's ever knocked me out and rolled it all into one elton john ha said of the album for me to say that i wa enthralled would be an understatement i had never heard such magical sound so amazingly recorded it undoubtedly changed the way that i and countless others approached recording it is a timeless and amazing recording of incredible genius and beauty beatles producer george martin stated that without pet sound sgt pepper would n't have happened pepper wa an attempt to equal pet sound paul mccartney ha said it wa pet sound that blew me out of the water i love the album so much i 've just bought my kid each a copy of it for their education in life i figure no one is educated musically 'til they 've heard that album i love the orchestra the arrangement it may be going overboard to say it 's the classic of the century but to me it certainly is a total classic record that is unbeatable in many way i 've often played pet sound and cried i played it to john lennon so much that it would be difficult for him to escape the influence it wa the record of the time the thing that really made me sit up and take notice wa the bass line and also putting melody in the bass line that i think wa probably the big influence that set me thinking when we recorded pepper it set me off on a period i had then for a couple of year of nearly always writing quite melodic bass line god only know is a big favourite of mine very emotional always a bit of a choker for me that one on you still believe in me i love that melody that kill me that 's my favourite i think it 's so beautiful right at the end come surging back in these multi coloured harmony sends shiver up my spine bob dylan ha said of brian wilson 's talent that ear i mean jesus he 's got to will that to the smithsonian roger water stated that along with sgt pepper pet sound completely changed everything about record for me elvis costello stated last summer i heard do n't talk put your head on my shoulder played on the cello it sounded beautiful and sad just a it doe on pet sound pete townshend stated 'god only knows' is simple and elegant and wa stunning when it first appeared it still sound perfect tom petty stated i think i would put him up there with any composer especially pet sound i do n't think there is anything better than that necessarily i do n't think you 'd be out of line comparing him to beethoven to any composer 

pet sound wa a whale of an album during it own day but it ha been slowly surpassed over the past 40 year when pet sound wa released in 1966 it wa indeed a musical masterstroke an album whose lush orchestration forever changed the concept of pop music yet there have been so many record released since that time that have gradually usurped this album 's status a the definitive lush pop album dark side of the moon loveless disintegration daydream nation all these album display a level of invention and sound density that make pet sound sound very dated much more so than say sgt pepper or are you experienced two album released at nearly the same time a this one and i know that some will say that those album would n't have been possible without pet sound but to paraphase a lou reed lyric 'what come is often better than what came before 'while it sonic marvel have dulled over time pet sound still boast some rich melody and beautiful harmony a well a some heartfelt love song it is a very good album one that often border on perfection i really like caroline no and would n't it be nice but i ca n't give this collection of song more than three star because it style of pop music is now pas eacute and clich eacute and there is no reason to elevate this particular album above so many others that are more innovative and timeless i think many critic canonize pet sound just so they can gleefully and wrongly proclaim that there is an album better than those of the beatles pet sound is a good pop album on it own term but it is not the 'greatest album of all time' that many believe it to be
